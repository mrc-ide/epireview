Reconstruction of Zika Virus Introduction in Brazil,"Zinszer, K.; Morrison, K.; Brownstein, J. S.; Marinho, F.; Santos, A. F.; Nsoesie, E. O.","We estimated the speed of Zika virus introduction in Brazil by using confirmed cases at the municipal level.

Predicted pattern of Zika virus infection distribution with reference to rainfall in Thailand,"Wiwanitkit, S.; Wiwanitkit, V.","Zika virus infection is the present global medical problem. The disease appears in several countries around the world. The relationship between rainfall and occurrence of Zika virus infection was previously mentioned. Here, the authors use the mathematical modeling technique to reappraise on the previous data on immunoreactivity rate of Zika virus, dengue virus and Ckikungunya virus in Thailand and the reported interrelationship between arboviral infections and rainfall in Thailand for constructing of the predicted pattern of Zika virus distribution in Thailand.

Dynamics of Zika virus outbreaks: an overview of mathematical modeling approaches,"Wiratsudakul, A.; Suparit, P.; Modchang, C.","Background: The Zika virus was first discovered in 1947. It was neglected until a major outbreak occurred on Yap Island, Micronesia, in 2007. Teratogenic effects resulting in microcephaly in newborn infants is the greatest public health threat. In 2016, the Zika virus epidemic was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Consequently, mathematical models were constructed to explicitly elucidate related transmission dynamics. Survey Methodology: In this review article, two steps of journal article searching were performed. First, we attempted to identify mathematical models previously applied to the study of vector-borne diseases using the search terms ""dynamics,"" ""mathematical model,"" ""modeling,"" and ""vector-borne"" together with the names of vector-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria, West Nile, and Zika. Then the identified types of model were further investigated. Second, we narrowed down our survey to focus on only Zika virus research. The terms we searched for were ""compartmental,"" ""spatial,"" ""metapopulation,"" ""network,"" ""individual-based,"" ""agent-based"" AND ""Zika."" All relevant studies were included regardless of the year of publication. We have collected research articles that were published before August 2017 based on our search criteria. In this publication survey, we explored the Google Scholar and PubMed databases. Results: We found five basic model architectures previously applied to vector-borne virus studies, particularly in Zika virus simulations. These include compartmental, spatial, metapopulation, network, and individual-based models. We found that Zika models carried out for early epidemics were mostly fit into compartmental structures and were less complicated compared to the more recent ones. Simple models are still commonly used for the timely assessment of epidemics. Nevertheless, due to the availability of large-scale real-world data and computational power, recently there has been growing interest in more complex modeling frameworks. Discussion: Mathematical models are employed to explore and predict how an infectious disease spreads in the real world, evaluate the disease importation risk, and assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies. As the trends in modeling of infectious diseases have been shifting towards data-driven approaches, simple and complex models should be exploited differently. Simple models can be produced in a timely fashion to provide an estimation of the possible impacts. In contrast, complex models integrating real-world data require more time to develop but are far more realistic. The preparation of complicated modeling frameworks prior to the outbreaks is recommended, including the case of future Zika epidemic preparation.",2018,,PeerJ,6,,e4526,29593941,10.7717/peerj.4526,,#148,Wiratsudakul 2018,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Useful review
First cases of Zika virus-infected US blood donors outside states with areas of active transmission,"Williamson, P. C.; Linnen, J. M.; Kessler, D. A.; Shaz, B. H.; Kamel, H.; Vassallo, R. R.; Winkelman, V.; Gao, K.; Ziermann, R.; Menezes, J.; Thomas, S.; Holmberg, J. A.; Bakkour, S.; Stone, M.; Lu, K.; Simmons, G.; Busch, M. P.","BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted by Aedes mosquitos and can result in severe congenital and adult neurologic abnormalities. ZIKV has rapidly spread northward through Central America and the Caribbean and autochthonous cases have been identified in the continental United States. High rates of ZIKA RNA positivity were detected in blood donors during previous epidemics. ZIKV transmission by transfused blood from healthy donor components has been a growing concern. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Individual-donation aliquots of plasma from volunteer blood donors were tested individually with an investigational Procleix ZIKV assay. Initially reactive samples were tested for ZIKV RNA in plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) and for ZIKV-specific antibodies in serum. A confirmed positive classification required confirmation of RNA and/or detection of ZIKV antibodies in index and/or follow-up samples. RESULTS: Between September 19 and November 30, 2016, a total of 466,834 donations were screened for ZIKV RNA. Five donors (one in approx. 93,000) were reactive for ZIKV RNA by both the Procleix ZIKV assay and supplemental testing. The donations were collected outside areas considered as having active transmission, and all five donors had travel exposures. A lookback case demonstrated no infection despite transfusion of a Zika IgG-positive platelet (PLT) component with probable low levels of ZIKV RNA. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes the first ZIKV-positive donors detected outside areas with active transmission. These donors most likely represent travel-acquired ""tail-end infections"" with prolonged RBC-associated ZIKV RNA. The lack of transmission to the recipient of an apheresis PLT may suggest that these units are not infectious.",2017,Mar,Transfusion,57,3pt2,770-778,28229475,10.1111/trf.14041,,#159,Williamson 2017,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Zika in travellers 1947-2017: a systematic review,"Wilder-Smith, A.; Chang, C. R.; Leong, W. Y.","Introduction: Travellers contributed substantially to the rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV). They act as sentinel and may unmask ongoing ZIKV transmission in countries where outbreaks have not yet been reported. Our objectives were to (i) describe the burden of ZIKV infections in international travellers over time; (ii) estimate the proportion of birth defects as a result of maternal ZIKV infection in travellers; (iii) track the extent of sexual transmission; (iv) summarize ZIKV infections in returning travellers as reported by the GeoSentinel network; and (v) identify countries without reports on local ZIKV transmission where travellers served as sentinel. Methods: We performed a systematic review from 1947 to April 2017 on travel-associated ZIKV infections. We also compared published reports on autochthonous ZIKV transmission in Asia with published reports on exportations from travellers in Asia. Results: Of 314 papers that fit the inclusion criteria, 61 were eligible for final analysis. There was an exponential increase in the number of reported ZIKV infected travellers from the years 2013 to 2016, which declined in 2017. Amongst pregnant women with ZIKV infection, (5%) resulted in a fetus or infant with ZIKV-associated birth defects. An estimated 1% of the total number of ZIKV cases reported in the USA and Europe were acquired through sexual transmission. Through the GeoSentinel network, five countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Cameroon) were identified as sentinel markers where ZIKV was exported despite the absence of reported local transmission. Conclusions: Mobility patterns and travel volumes can help to identify the most likely origin of importation, and also in predicting further propagation. Studies on pregnant returning travellers have contributed to a better understanding of the risk estimates of congenital Zika syndrome/microcephaly as a result of maternal ZIKV infection, and the relative contribution of sexual transmisison.",2018,Jul-01,J Travel Med,25,1,,30016469,10.1093/jtm/tay044,,#173,Wilder-Smith 2018,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,
Zika virus from a Southeast Asian perspective,"Wikan, N.; Smith, D. R.","Phylogenic evidence suggests that the strain of Zika virus causing an unprecedented outbreak of disease in the Americas had its origin in Southeast Asia, where reports of isolated cases of Zika virus infection have occurred since 2010. Why there has been no large outbreak of Zika infection in Southeast Asia remains unclear and whether such an outbreak will occur in the future is a question of significant concern.

Detection of Zika virus infection among asymptomatic pregnant women in the North of Peru,"Weilg, C.; Troyes, L.; Villegas, Z.; Silva-Caso, W.; Mazulis, F.; Febres, A.; Troyes, M.; Aguilar-Luis, M. A.; Del Valle-Mendoza, J.","OBJECTIVE: To report an outbreak of ZIKV infection among asymptomatic pregnant women during 2016 in the city of Jaen, Cajamarca. RESULTS: Zika virus RNA was detected in 3.2% (n = 36) of cases by RT-PCR. The mean age of patients positive for ZIKV infection was 29.6 years. 7 patients (19.4%) infected with ZIKV were in their first-trimester of gestation, 13 (36.1%) were in their second-trimester, and 16 (44%) were in their third-trimester. All of the infected pregnant women were asymptomatic. ZIKV infection remains a major public health issue that calls for constant epidemiological surveillance. It can cause the congenital Zika virus syndrome in the newborns of infected mothers. The lack of molecular diagnostic methods in isolated localities and the similarity of symptoms to other arboviral infections, lead to an under-diagnosis of this disease in endemic areas.",2018,May-18,BMC Res Notes,11,1,311,29776426,10.1186/s13104-018-3400-z,,#206,Weilg 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Epidemic potential of Zika virus in Australia: implications for blood transfusion safety,"Watson-Brown, P.; Viennet, E.; Mincham, G.; Williams, C. R.; Jansen, C. C.; Montgomery, B. L.; Flower, R. L. P.; Faddy, H. M.","BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is transfusion-transmissible. In Australia the primary vector, Aedes aegypti, is established in the north-east, such that local transmission is possible following importation of an index case, which has the potential to impact on blood transfusion safety and public health. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) to model the epidemic potential of ZIKV in Australian locations, compared this with the ecologically similar dengue viruses (DENV), and examined possible implications for blood transfusion safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Varying estimates of vector control efficiency and extrinsic incubation period, ""best-case"" and ""worst-case"" scenarios of monthly R 0 for ZIKV and DENV were modeled from 1996 to 2015 in 11 areas. We visualized the geographical distribution of blood donors in relation to areas with epidemic potential for ZIKV. RESULTS: Epidemic potential (R 0 > 1) existed for ZIKV and DENV throughout the study period in a number of locations in northern Australia (Cairns, Darwin, Rockhampton, Thursday Island, Townsville, and Brisbane) during the warmer months of the year. R 0 for DENV was greater than ZIKV and was broadly consistent with annual estimates in Cairns. Increased vector control efficiency markedly reduced the epidemic potential and shortened the season of local transmission. Australian locations that provide the greatest number of blood donors did not have epidemic potential for ZIKV. CONCLUSION: We estimate that areas of north-eastern Australia could sustain local transmission of ZIKV. This early contribution to understanding the epidemic potential of ZIKV may assist in the assessment and management of threats to blood transfusion safety.",2019,Feb,Transfusion,59,2,648-658,30618208,10.1111/trf.15095,,#225,Watson-Brown 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Zika Virus and the World Health Organization Criteria for Determining Recent Infection Using Plaque Reduction Neutralization Testing,"Ward, M.

M.","The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic swept across Latin America and the Caribbean, where dengue virus (DENV) is endemic. The antigenic similarities of these closely related flaviviruses left researchers and clinicians with challenges to interpret serological tests. Thirty-six women attending a prenatal clinic in Honduras and with positive DENV IgM enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISAs) were screened with a ZIKV immunoglobulin M ELISA, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for ZIKV and DENV 1-4, and plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) for ZIKV and DENV-2. Plaque reduction neutralization test results were interpreted using the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Using the WHO criteria of a PRNT90 titer >/= 20 and a 4-fold difference between ZIKV and DENV titers, we determined that 69.4% of samples had a recent ZIKV infection, compared with 5.6% using CDC criteria.

A cluster of Zika virus infection among travellers returning to China from Samoa: a case tracing study,"Wang, G.; Zheng, W.; Zhu, S.; Wu, Z.; Lam, T. T.; Tong, Y.; Qi, R.","Background: A febrile man, who returned to China after a 9-day travel in Fiji and Samoa, was detected to be infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) at the port by Shenzhen Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau on 14 February 2016. Methods: The patient and his 32 travelling companions were traced for ZIKV infection. A standardised questionnaire was used to obtain the information on demographics, clinical manifestations and exposure history. Their samples were tested for ZIKV by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The positive samples were subjected to viral culture and genome sequencing. Findings: Four of the 33 travellers were confirmed to be infected by ZIKV through qRT-PCR and viral culture, with an overall infection rate of 12%. Interestingly, one case (Patient 3) where high viremia levels were tested 4 days prior to symptoms. In addition, a 7-year-old girl was identified to have ZIKV infection on 17 February, but never had any manifestation. ZIKV was isolated from the four imported cases. Phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences revealed that these isolates were similar to each other and close to the strain causing the French Polynesia outbreak in 2013.

"Epidemic Potential for Local Transmission of Zika Virus in 2015 and 2016 in Queensland, Australia","Viennet, E.; Mincham, G.; Frentiu, F. D.; Jansen, C. C.; Montgomery, B. L.; Harley, D.; Flower, R. L.; Williams, C. R.; Faddy, H. M.","INTRODUCTION: Zika virus could be transmitted in the state of Queensland, Australia, in parts of the state where the mosquito vectors are established. METHODS: We assessed the epidemic potential of Zika in Queensland from January 2015 to August 2016, and estimate the epidemic potential from September to December 2016, by calculating the temperature-dependent relative vectorial capacity (rVc), based on empirical and estimated parameters. RESULTS: Through 2015, we estimated a rVc of 0.119, 0.152, 0.170, and 0.175, respectively in the major cities of Brisbane, Rockhampton, Cairns, and Townsville. From January to August 2016, the epidemic potential trend was similar to 2015, however the highest epidemic potential was in Cairns. During September to November 2016, the epidemic potential is consistently the highest in Cairns, followed by Townsville, Rockhampton and Brisbane. Then, from November to December 2016, Townsville has the highest estimated epidemic potential. DISCUSSION: We demonstrate using a vectorial capacity model that ZIKV could have been locally transmitted in Queensland, Australia during 2015 and 2016. ZIKV remains a threat to Australia for the upcoming summer, during the Brazilian Carnival season, when the abundance of vectors is relatively high.

OBJECTIVE: To assess and identify possible risk factors for ophthalmoscopic findings in infants born with microcephaly and a presumed clinical diagnosis of ZIKV intrauterine infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross-sectional study at the Altino Ventura Foundation in Recife, Brazil, that included 40 infants with microcephaly born in Pernambuco state, Brazil, between May and December 2015. Toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus were ruled out in all of them. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid for ZIKV using IgM antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed in 24 of 40 infants (60.0%). The infants and mothers underwent ocular examinations. The infants were divided into 2 groups, those with and without ophthalmoscopic alterations, for comparison. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification of risk factors for ophthalmoscopic findings in infants born with microcephaly and ZIKV intrauterine infection. RESULTS: Among the 40 infants, the mean (SD) age was 2.2 (1.2) months (range, 0.1-7.3 months). Of the 24 infants tested, 100% had positive results for ZIKV infection: 14 of 22 infants (63.6%) from the group with ophthalmoscopic findings and 10 of 18 infants (55.6%) from the group without ophthalmoscopic findings. The major symptoms reported in both groups were rash by 26 mothers (65.0%), fever by 9 mothers (22.5%), headache by 9 mothers (22.5%), and arthralgia by 8 mothers (20.0%). No mothers reported conjunctivitis or other ocular symptoms during pregnancy or presented signs of uveitis at the time of examination.

Reproduction numbers of infectious disease models,"van den Driessche, P.","This primer article focuses on the basic reproduction number, 0 , for infectious diseases, and other reproduction numbers related to 0 that are useful in guiding control strategies. Beginning with a simple population model, the concept is developed for a threshold value of 0 determining whether or not the disease dies out. The next generation matrix method of calculating 0 in a compartmental model is described and illustrated. To address control strategies, type and target reproduction numbers are defined, as well as sensitivity and elasticity indices. These theoretical ideas are then applied to models that are formulated for West Nile virus in birds (a vector-borne disease), cholera in humans (a disease with two transmission pathways), anthrax in animals (a disease that can be spread by dead carcasses and spores), and Zika in humans (spread by mosquitoes and sexual contacts). Some parameter values from literature data are used to illustrate the results. Finally, references for other ways to calculate 0 are given. These are useful for more complicated models that, for example, take account of variations in environmental fluctuation or stochasticity.",2017,Aug,Infect Dis Model,2,3,288-303,29928743,10.1016/j.idm.2017.06.002,,#349,vandenDriessche 2017,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; Extractorá (2019-10-31 23:29:27)(Select): report estimated R0; ,
"Clinical and nerve conduction features in Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with Zika virus infection in Cucuta, Colombia","Uncini, A.; Gonzalez-Bravo, D. C.; Acosta-Ampudia, Y. Y.; Ojeda, E. C.; Rodriguez, Y.; Monsalve, D. M.; Ramirez-Santana, C.; Vega, D. A.; Paipilla, D.; Torres, L.; Molano-Gonzalez, N.; Osorio, J. E.; Anaya, J. M.","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with an increased incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) but the relative frequency of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) and axonal GBS subtypes is controversial. METHODS: Twenty GBS patients diagnosed according to the Brighton criteria during the ZIKV outbreak in Cucuta, Colombia, were evaluated clinically and electrophysiologically. The electrodiagnosis of GBS subtypes was made according to a recently described criteria set that demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy on the basis of a single test. The electrophysiological features of 34 Italian AIDP patients were used as control. RESULTS: All patients had symptoms compatible with ZIKV infection before the onset of GBS and ZIKV infection was laboratory confirmed through a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90 ) in 100% of patients. The median time from onset of ZIKV infection symptoms to GBS was 5 days (interquartile range 1-6 days). Cranial nerve palsy was present in 85% of patients (facial palsy in 75%, bulbar nerve involvement in 60%), autonomic dysfunction in 85%, and 50% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. AIDP was diagnosed in 70% of patients. 40% of nerves of AIDP patients showed a prevalent distal demyelinating involvement but this pattern was not different from the Italian AIDP patients without ZIKV infection. CONCLUSIONS: Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with ZIKV infection in Cucuta is characterized by a high frequency of cranial nerve involvement, autonomic dysfunction and requirement of mechanical ventilation indicating an aggressive and severe course.

Eleven GBS cases, consecutively enrolled into our prospective GBS database from onset to 4 weeks after outbreak, and six controls, comprising three GBS patients enrolled before outbreak and three non-GBS patients, were examined for evidence of recent ZIKV infection. We performed serum, urine ZIKV RT-PCR, ZIKV serology, and virus neutralization assays, accounting for cross-reaction and co-infection with dengue (DENV). We found five GBS cases with only serological evidence of recent ZIKV infection (including one ZIKV-DENV co-infection). A temporal relationship with ZIKV outbreak was unlikely as two cases were GBS controls enrolled 3 months before outbreak. None reported symptoms of ZIKV infection.

METHODS: Infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure were referred for evaluation during the 2015-2016 Rio de Janeiro outbreak. Mothers with symptomatic ZIKV infection during pregnancy and/or infants with microcephaly or other findings that were suggestive of suspected antenatal exposure were tested with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Complete eye examinations were performed by pediatric ophthalmologists between January 2016 and February 2017. The main outcome measure was eye abnormalities in RT-PCR-positive and suspected (ie, not tested or RT-PCR-negative) antenatal ZIKV cases. RESULTS: Of 224 infants, 189 had RT-PCR testing performed. Of 189 patients, 156 had positive RT-PCR results in their blood, urine, and/or placenta. Of 224 infants, 90 had central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, including microcephaly (62 infants). Eye abnormalities were present in 57 of 224 (25.4%) infants. Optic nerve (44 of 57; 77.2%) and retina abnormalities (37 of 57; 64.9%) were the most common. The group with suspected ZIKV infection (68 infants) had proportionally more eye (36.8% vs 20.5%; P = .022) and CNS abnormalities (68.3% vs 28.1%; P = .008), likely because of referral patterns. Eye abnormalities consistent with ZIKV infection were clinically comparable in both RT-PCR-positive and unconfirmed groups, including 4 RT-PCR-positive infants of 5 without any CNS abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Similar eye manifestations were identified regardless of laboratory confirmation. Well-appearing infants were also found to have eye abnormalities. Therefore, all infants born after ZIKV outbreaks should be universally screened for eye abnormalities.",2018,Oct,Pediatrics,142,4,,30213843,10.1542/peds.2018-1104,,#397,Tsui 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Zika Virus: a Review from the Virus Basics to Proposed Management Strategies,"Zammarchi, L.; Spinicci, M.; Bartoloni, A.","This review aims to summarize the body of knowledge available on Zika virus to date. A comprehensive review of the scientific literature on Zika virus was performed with the aim to stress relevant aspects for healthcare professionals in the non-endemic areas. For several years, the Zika virus infection was considered an extremely rare exotic disease with poor clinical relevance. However, Zika virus has recently gained the attention of the scientific community and public opinion since the virus spread to the Pacific islands and the South America in an unprecedented epidemic, and additionally due to the definitive evidence that the infection could be complicated by Guillain-Barre syndrome, passed through vertical transmission, and result in central nervous system abnormalities (including microcephaly) of the fetus. Studies and scientific evidence on the complications associated with Zika virus infection are growing day by day. It is advisable that the healthcare professionals working in non-endemic areas maintain full awareness on this issue in order to practice proper management of the imported cases of Zika virus infection.",2016,,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,8,1,e2016056,27872736,10.4084/mjhid.2016.056,,#479,Zammarchi 2016,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-09-12 00:30:14)(Select): review; ,Phylogenetic studies

The virus was discovered 70years ago, yet the knowledge about its genomic structure and the genetic variations associated with current ZIKV explosive epidemics remains not fully understood. In this review, the genome organization, especially conserved terminal structures of ZIKV genome were characterized and compared with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses. It is suggested that major viral proteins of ZIKV share high structural and functional similarity with other known flaviviruses as shown by sequence comparison and prediction of functional motifs in viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all ZIKV strains circulating in the America form a unique clade within the Asian lineage. Furthermore, we identified a series of conserved amino acid residues that differentiate the Asian strains including the current circulating American strains from the ancient African strains.

"Estimating the effects of variation in viremia on mosquito susceptibility, infectiousness, and R0 of Zika in Aedes aegypti","Tesla, B.; Demakovsky, L. R.; Packiam, H. S.; Mordecai, E. A.; Rodriguez, A. D.; Bonds, M. H.; Brindley, M. A.; Murdock, C. C.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Like most viral infections, ZIKV viremia varies over several orders of magnitude, with unknown consequences for transmission. To determine the effect of viral concentration on ZIKV transmission risk, we exposed field-derived Ae. aegypti mosquitoes to four doses (10(3), 10(4), 10(5), 10(6) PFU/mL) representative of potential variation in the field. We demonstrate that increasing ZIKV dose in the blood-meal significantly increases the probability of mosquitoes becoming infected, and consequently disseminating virus and becoming infectious. Additionally, we observed significant interactions between dose and days post-infection on dissemination and overall transmission efficiency, suggesting that variation in ZIKV dose affects the rates of midgut escape and salivary gland invasion. We did not find significant effects of dose on mosquito mortality. We also demonstrate that detecting virus using RT-qPCR approaches rather than plaque assays potentially over-estimates key transmission parameters, including the time at which mosquitoes become infectious and viral burden. Finally, using these data to parameterize an R0 model, we showed that increasing viremia from 10(4) to 10(6) PFU/mL increased relative R0 3.8-fold, demonstrating that variation in viremia substantially affects transmission risk.",2018,Aug,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,12,8,e0006733,30133450,10.1371/journal.pntd.0006733,,#555,Tesla 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-03-20 04:15:49)(Included): mosquito-only study; pushed back to full text review; ,

"Zika Virus: Transmission, Detection, Control, and Prevention","Sharma, A.; Lal, S. K.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus discovered in Uganda in the 1940s. To date, three major ZIKV outbreaks have been reported. ZIKV infections have known to be primarily asymptomatic while causing mild illness in a few cases. However, the recent emergence and spread of ZIKV in the Americas has resulted in the declaration of ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"" due to the potential association between the infection and prenatal microcephaly or other brain anomalies. In Brazil, a 20-fold increase in prenatal microcephaly cases and 19% increase in Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) cases were reported in 2015, as compared to the preceding year. The probable deleterious effects of ZIKV infection prompt the urgent development of diagnostics and therapeutics. To this end, the existing evidences supporting the increasingly common prenatal microcephaly and GBS association and the current known ZIKV transmission dynamics, modes of detection (molecular and serology-based), and current control strategies are summarized in this review. This review also emphasizes the importance of understanding ZIKV transmission in order to design a sensitive yet cost and time-efficient detection technique. Development of an efficient detection technique would subsequently allow for better surveillance and control of ZIKV infection.

T.","In early 2015, an outbreak of Zika virus, a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, was identified in northeast Brazil, an area where dengue virus was also circulating. By September, reports of an increase in the number of infants born with microcephaly in Zika virus-affected areas began to emerge, and Zika virus RNA was identified in the amniotic fluid of two women whose fetuses had been found to have microcephaly by prenatal ultrasound. The Brazil Ministry of Health (MoH) established a task force to investigate the possible association of microcephaly with Zika virus infection during pregnancy and a registry for incident microcephaly cases (head circumference >/=2 standard deviations [SD] below the mean for sex and gestational age at birth) and pregnancy outcomes among women suspected to have had Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Among a cohort of 35 infants with microcephaly born during August-October 2015 in eight of Brazil's 26 states and reported to the registry, the mothers of all 35 had lived in or visited Zika virus-affected areas during pregnancy, 25 (71%) infants had severe microcephaly (head circumference >3 SD below the mean for sex and gestational age), 17 (49%) had at least one neurologic abnormality, and among 27 infants who had neuroimaging studies, all had abnormalities. Tests for other congenital infections were negative. All infants had a lumbar puncture as part of the evaluation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were sent to a reference laboratory in Brazil for Zika virus testing; results are not yet available. Further studies are needed to confirm the association of microcephaly with Zika virus infection during pregnancy and to understand any other adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with Zika virus infection.

M.; Lein, A.; Branco, Mdrfc; Aquino, J. Junior; Rodrigues, Z. M. R.; da Silva, A. A. M.; Staton, C.","BACKGROUND: Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic ceased to be a public health emergency by the end of 2016, studies to improve knowledge about this emerging disease are still needed, especially those investigating a causal relationship between ZIKV in pregnant women and microcephaly in neonates. However, there are still many challenges in describing the relationship between ZIKV and microcephaly. The few studies focusing on the epidemiological profile of ZIKV and its changes over time are largely limited to systematic reviews of case reports and dispersal mapping of ZIKV spread over time without quantitative methods to analyze patterns and their covariates. Since Brazil has been at the epicenter of the ZIKV epidemic, this study examines the geospatial association between ZIKV and microcephaly in Brazil. METHODS: Our study is categorized as a retrospective, ecological study based on secondary databases. Data were obtained from January to December 2016, from the following data sources: Brazilian System for Epidemiological Surveillance, Disease Notification System, System for Specialized Management Support, and Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Data were aggregated by municipality. Incidence rates were estimated per 100,000 inhabitants. Analyses consisted of mapping the aggregated incidence rates of ZIKV and microcephaly, followed by a Getis-Ord-Gi spatial cluster analysis and a Bivariate Local Moran's I analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of ZIKV cases is changing the virus's spatial pattern, shifting from Brazil's Northeast region to the Midwest and North regions. The number of municipalities in clusters of microcephaly incidence is also shifting from the Northeast region to the Midwest and North, after a time lag is considered. Our findings suggest an increase in microcephaly incidence in the Midwest and North regions, associated with high levels of ZIKV infection months before. CONCLUSION: The greatest burden of microcephaly shifted from the Northeast to other Brazilian regions at the beginning of 2016. Brazil's Midwest region experienced an increase in microcephaly incidence associated with ZIKV incidence.

Breastfeeding in the time of Zika: a systematic literature review,"Sampieri, C. L.; Montero, H.","Background: The disease Zika is considered as emergent. The infection can be acquired through different routes: a bite from the Aedes mosquito, sexual contact, from mother to child during pregnancy and by blood transfusion. The possibility of Zika transmission through human lactation has been considered. Zika is a disease of great concern for public health because it has been associated with neonatal and postnatal microcephaly, among other birth defects. Objectives: To review published evidence of the probable transmission of Zika through human lactation. Data sources: Electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBSCO, Gale, Science Direct, Scopus, US National Library of Medicine (PubMed) and Web of Science. World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web pages. Study eligibility criteria: To be eligible, studies of any design had to provide primary data of human breast milk as a potential fluid for the transmission of Zika, or primary or secondary follow-up data of infants with at least one previous published study that complied with the first criterion of eligibility. Participants: Studies about women with suspected, probable or confirmed Zika during pregnancy, or the postnatal period and beyond. Studies about infants who breastfeed directly from the breast or where fed with the expressed breast milk of the suspected, probable or confirmed women with Zika. Results: This study only chose data from research papers; no patients were taken directly by the authors. A total of 1,146 were screened and nine studies were included in the qualitative synthesis, from which a total of 10 cases were identified, with documented follow-up in three of these cases. Through the timing of maternal Zika infection, five cases were classified as prenatal (time before delivery), one as immediate postnatal (period from 0 to 4 days after birth); no cases were classified as medium postnatal (period from 5 days to 8 weeks after birth); two were classified as long postnatal (period from 8 weeks to 6 months after birth) and two as beyond six months after birth. Conclusion: Human milk may be considered as a potentially infectious fluid, but we found no currently documented studies of the long-term complications in infants up to 32 months of age, with suspected, probable or confirmed Zika through human lactation, or evidence with respect to the human pathophysiology of the infection acquired through human lactation.

A GBS incidence estimation and clinical description was performed to assess baseline GBS epidemiology before the introduction of Zika virus in Puerto Rico. METHODS: Hospitalization administrative data from an island-wide insurance claims database and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates provided a crude GBS incidence for 2013. This estimate was adjusted using the proportion of GBS cases meeting Brighton criteria for confirmed GBS from nine reference hospitals. Characteristics of confirmed GBS cases in the same nine hospitals during 2012-2015 are described. RESULTS: A total of 136 GBS hospitalization claims were filed in 2013 (crude GBS incidence was 3.8 per 100,000 population). The adjusted GBS incidence was 1.7 per 100,000 population. Of 67 confirmed GBS cases during 2012-2015, 66% had an antecedent illness. Median time from antecedent illness to GBS onset was 7days. Most cases (67%) occurred during July-September.

Detecting Local Zika Virus Transmission in the Continental United States: A Comparison of Surveillance Strategies,"Russell, S.; Ryff, K.; Gould, C.; Martin, S.; Johansson, M.","Introduction: The 2015-2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas has driven efforts to strengthen surveillance systems and to develop interventions, testing, and travel recommendations. In the continental U.S. and Hawaii, where limited transmission has been observed, detecting local transmission is a key public health objective. We assessed the effectiveness of three general surveillance strategies for this situation: testing all pregnant women twice during pregnancy, testing blood donations, and testing symptomatic people who seek medical care in an emergency department (ED). Methods: We developed a simulation model for each surveillance strategy and simulated different transmission scenarios with varying population sizes and infection rates. We then calculated the probability of detecting transmission, the number of tests needed, and the number of false positive test results. Results: The probability of detecting ZIKV transmission was highest for testing ED patients with Zika symptoms, followed by pregnant women and blood donors, in that order. The magnitude of the difference in probability of detection between strategies depended on the incidence of infection. Testing ED patients required fewer tests and resulted in fewer false positives than surveillance among pregnant women. The optimal strategy identified was to test ED patients with at least two Zika virus disease symptoms. This case definition resulted in a high probability of detection with relatively few tests and false positives. Discussion: In the continental U.S. and Hawaii, where local ZIKV transmission is rare, optimizing the probability of detecting infections while minimizing resource usage is particularly important. Local surveillance strategies will be influenced by existing public health system infrastructure, but should also consider the effectiveness of different approaches. This analysis demonstrated differences across strategies and indicated that testing symptomatic ED patients is generally a more efficient strategy for detecting transmission than routine testing of pregnant women or blood donors.",2017,Nov-22,PLoS Curr,9,,,29985488,10.1371/currents.outbreaks.cd76717676629d47704170ecbdb5f820,,#834,Russell 2017,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,

J.; Lozada-Riascos, C. O.; de Pijper, C. A.; Grobusch, M. P.","OBJECTIVE: Geographical information systems (GIS) have been demonstrated earlier to be of great use to inform public health action against vector-borne infectious diseases. METHODS: Using surveillance data on the ongoing ZIKV outbreak from Pereira, Colombia (2015-2016), we estimated incidence rates (cases/100,000 population), and developed maps correlating with the ecoepidemiology of the area. RESULTS: Up to October 8, 2016, 439 cases of ZIKV were reported in Pereira (93 cases/100,000 pop.), with highest rates in the South-West area. At the corregiments (sub-municipalities) of Pereira, Caimalito presented the highest rate. An urban area, Cuba, has 169 cases/100,000 pop., with a low economical level and the highest Aedic index (9.1%). Entomological indexes were associated with ZIKV incidence at simple and multiple non-linear regressions (r(2) > 0.25; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Combining entomological, environmental, human population density, travel patterns and case data of vector-borne infections, such as ZIKV, leads to a valuable tool that can be used to pinpoint hotspots also for infections such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria. Such a tool is key to planning mosquito control and the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases in local populations.

S.; Koster, I.; Rodrigues, P. P.; Gomes, M. F.; Macedo, A. F.; Gerardi, A.; Leite, I. D. C.","BACKGROUND: Dengue epidemics have occurred in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) since 1986. In the year 2015, Zika and chikungunya viruses were introduced in the city, causing sequential and simultaneous epidemics. Poor socioeconomic conditions have been suggested as contributing factors of arboviral infection. OBJECTIVE: To describe the spatial distribution of human cases of symptomatic arboviral infections and to identify risk factors for infection in a poor community of Rio de Janeiro in the years 2015 and 2016. METHODS: We built thematic maps of incidence rates for 78 micro-areas in the Manguinhos neighborhood. The micro-areas congregate about 600 inhabitants. Simple and multiple multilevel logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between the incidence of arboviral diseases and socio-demographic factors at both the individual and micro-area levels. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2016, 370 human cases of arbovirus infection were reported in the Manguinhos community: 123 in 2015 and 247 in 2016. There was a significant difference in the risk of arbovirus diseases among different micro-areas, but this was not explained by water and sanitation indicators. The cumulative incidence rate was 849/100,000 in two years. The incidence was greater in those individuals with familiar vulnerability (1,156/100,000 vs. 794/100,000). The multilevel adjusted model showed that the odds of acquiring an arbovirus infection was 55% greater in those with familiar vulnerability. CONCLUSION: Arbovirus infections cause a high burden of disease in Brazilian urban centers. Our results suggest that even in poor neighborhoods, there is a high spatial variability in the risk of acquiring an arbovirus infection. The conditions that favor vector proliferation and infection by arboviruses are complex and involve both individual and environmental characteristics that vary from place to place. To reduce the burden of arboviral diseases, continued public health policies and basic services should be provided to the communities at risk that consider specific local needs.",2018,,PLoS One,13,6,e0198357,29879155,10.1371/journal.pone.0198357,,#915,Rodrigues 2018,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,

A.","BACKGROUND: In collaboration with state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments, CDC established the U.S. Zika Pregnancy Registry (USZPR) in early 2016 to monitor pregnant women with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection and their infants. METHODS: This report includes an analysis of completed pregnancies (which include live births and pregnancy losses, regardless of gestational age) in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (DC) with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection reported to the USZPR from January 15 to December 27, 2016. Birth defects potentially associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy include brain abnormalities and/or microcephaly, eye abnormalities, other consequences of central nervous system dysfunction, and neural tube defects and other early brain malformations. RESULTS: During the analysis period, 1,297 pregnant women in 44 states were reported to the USZPR. Zika virus-associated birth defects were reported for 51 (5%) of the 972 fetuses/infants from completed pregnancies with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4%-7%); the proportion was higher when restricted to pregnancies with laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection (24/250 completed pregnancies [10%, 95% CI = 7%-14%]). Birth defects were reported in 15% (95% CI = 8%-26%) of fetuses/infants of completed pregnancies with confirmed Zika virus infection in the first trimester. Among 895 liveborn infants from pregnancies with possible recent Zika virus infection, postnatal neuroimaging was reported for 221 (25%), and Zika virus testing of at least one infant specimen was reported for 585 (65%). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: These findings highlight why pregnant women should avoid Zika virus exposure. Because the full clinical spectrum of congenital Zika virus infection is not yet known, all infants born to women with laboratory evidence of possible recent Zika virus infection during pregnancy should receive postnatal neuroimaging and Zika virus testing in addition to a comprehensive newborn physical exam and hearing screen.

T.","BACKGROUND: Starting in August 2015, there was an increase in the number of cases of neonatal microcephaly in Northeast Brazil. These findings were identified as being an epidemic of microcephaly related to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. The present study aims to analyse the spatial distribution of microcephaly cases in Recife (2015-2016), which is in Northeast Brazil, and its association with the living conditions in this city. METHODS: This was an ecological study that used data from reported cases of microcephaly from the State Health Department of Pernambuco (August 2015 to July 2016). The basic spatial unit of analysis was the 94 districts of Recife. The case definition of microcephaly was: neonates with a head circumference of less than the cut-off point of -2 standard deviations below the mean value from the established Fenton growth curve. As an indicator of the living conditions of the 94 districts, the percentage of heads of households with an income of less than twice the minimum wage was calculated. The districts were classified into four homogeneous strata using the K-means clustering algorithm. We plotted the locations of each microcephaly case over a layer of living conditions. RESULTS: During the study period, 347 microcephaly cases were reported, of which 142 (40.9%) fulfilled the definition of a microcephaly case. Stratification of the 94 districts resulted in the identification of four strata. The highest stratum in relation to the living conditions presented the lowest prevalence rate of microcephaly, and the overall difference between this rate and the rates of the other strata was statistically significant. The results of the Kruskal-Wallis test demonstrated that there was a strong association between a higher prevalence of microcephaly and poor living conditions. After the first 6 months of the study period, there were no microcephaly cases recorded within the population living in the richest socio-economic strata.

We constructed thematic maps of districts, according to socio-environmental and vector indicators. We identified spatial aggregates of newborns with microcephaly by using the Bernoulli model. We performed logistic regression analyses to compare the incidence risk of microcephaly within socio-environmental indicator groups. RESULTS: We geocoded 17 990 of 19 554 (92.0%) live births in Recife, of which 202 (1.1%) newborns were classified as having microcephaly, based on a head circumference of >/=2 standard deviations below the mean.

Historically, ZIKV spread eastward from equatorial Africa and Asia to the Pacific Islands during the late 2000s to early 2010s, invaded the Caribbean and Central and South America in 2015, and reached North America in 2016. Although ZIKV infection generally causes no symptoms or only a mild self-limiting illness, it has recently been linked to a rising number of severe neurological diseases, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Because of the continuous geographic expansion of both the virus and its mosquito vectors, ZIKV poses a serious threat to public health around the globe.

Overview of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in regards to the Brazilian epidemic,"Slavov, S. N.; Otaguiri, K. K.; Kashima, S.; Covas, D. T.","Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, belongs to the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus. ZIKV was initially isolated in 1947 from a sentinel monkey in the Zika forest, Uganda. Little clinical importance was attributed to ZIKV, once only few symptomatic cases were reported in some African and Southeast Asiatic countries. This situation changed in 2007, when a large outbreak was registered on the Yap Island, Micronesia, caused by the Asian ZIKV lineage. Between 2013 and 2014, ZIKV spread explosively and caused many outbreaks in different islands of the Southern Pacific Ocean and in 2015 autochthonous transmission was reported in Brazil. Currently, Brazil is the country with the highest number of ZIKV-positive cases in Latin America. Moreover, for the first time after the discovery of ZIKV, the Brazilian scientists are studying the possibility for the virus to cause severe congenital infection related to microcephaly and serious birth defects due to the time-spatial coincidence of the alarming increase of newborns with microcephaly and the Brazilian ZIKV epidemic.

"Zika virus RNA detection in asymptomatic blood donors during an outbreak in the northeast region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, 2016","Slavov, S. N.; Hespanhol, M. R.; Rodrigues, E. S.; Levi, J. E.; Ubiali, E. M. A.; Covas, D. T.; Kashima, S.","BACKGROUND: In 2015, there was a large Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil. The proportion of asymptomatic infections is very high, and it is possible for transfusion-transmitted ZIKV (TT-ZIKV) infection to occur. The prevalence of asymptomatic ZIKV infection among Brazilian blood donors during this epidemic outbreak is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma samples obtained between October 2015 and May 2016 from 1393 volunteer blood donors were tested for ZIKV RNA. The viral load was quantified using an in-house standard curve. Additionally, positive ZIKV RNA samples were tested for anti-ZIKV immunoglobulin (Ig)M and anti-ZIKV IgG. RESULTS: Of the 1393 blood samples, ZIKV RNA was detected in 37 (n = 37/1393; 2.7%). The median infection viral load detected was 7714 copies/mL (ranging from 135-124,220 copies/mL). The majority of the positive samples (70.3%) exhibited a viral load of approximately 10(3) copies/mL. Six samples that were positive for ZIKV RNA were also positive for anti-ZIKV IgM and IgG (n = 6/37; 13.5%). CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating the prevalence of ZIKV RNA among Brazilian blood donors, which was relatively high and might lead to TT-ZIKV infection.

On a weekly basis between January 1, 2014 and October 1, 2016 at three administrative levels, we collated spatiotemporal Zika incidence data, nine environmental variables, and demographic data into a single downloadable database. These new datasets and those we identified, processed, and assembled at comparable spatial and temporal resolutions will save future researchers considerable time and effort in performing these data processing steps, enabling them to focus instead on extracting epidemiological insights from this important data set. Similar approaches could prove useful for filling data gaps to enable epidemiological analyses of future disease emergence events.",2018,Apr-24,Sci Data,5,,180073,29688216,10.1038/sdata.2018.73,,#1153,Siraj 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Environmental and social determinants of population vulnerability to Zika virus emergence at the local scale,"Rees, E. E.; Petukhova, T.; Mascarenhas, M.; Pelcat, Y.; Ogden, N. H.","BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) spread rapidly in the Americas in 2015. Targeting effective public health interventions for inhabitants of, and travellers to and from, affected countries depends on understanding the risk of ZIKV emergence (and re-emergence) at the local scale. We explore the extent to which environmental, social and neighbourhood disease intensity variables influenced emergence dynamics. Our objective was to characterise population vulnerability given the potential for sustained autochthonous ZIKV transmission and the timing of emergence. Logistic regression models estimated the probability of reporting at least one case of ZIKV in a given municipality over the course of the study period as an indicator for sustained transmission; while accelerated failure time (AFT) survival models estimated the time to a first reported case of ZIKV in week t for a given municipality as an indicator for timing of emergence. RESULTS: Sustained autochthonous ZIKV transmission was best described at the temporal scale of the study period (almost one year), such that high levels of study period precipitation and low mean study period temperature reduced the probability. Timing of ZIKV emergence was best described at the weekly scale for precipitation in that high precipitation in the current week delayed reporting. Both modelling approaches detected an effect of high poverty on reducing/slowing case detection, especially when inter-municipal road connectivity was low. We also found that proximity to municipalities reporting ZIKV had an effect to reduce timing of emergence when located, on average, less than 100 km away. CONCLUSIONS: The different modelling approaches help distinguish between large temporal scale factors driving vector habitat suitability and short temporal scale factors affecting the speed of spread. We find evidence for inter-municipal movements of infected people as a local-scale driver of spatial spread. The negative association with poverty suggests reduced case reporting in poorer areas. Overall, relatively simplistic models may be able to predict the vulnerability of populations to autochthonous ZIKV transmission at the local scale.",2018,May-08,Parasit Vectors,11,1,290,29739467,10.1186/s13071-018-2867-8,,#1194,Rees 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Studying the effects of emerging infections on the fetus: Experience with West Nile and Zika viruses,"Rasmussen, S. A.; Meaney-Delman, D. M.; Petersen, L. R.; Jamieson, D. J.","Emerging infections have the potential to produce adverse effects on the pregnant woman or her fetus; however, studying these effects is often challenging. We review our experiences with investigating the prenatal effects of two mosquito-borne infections that emerged in the past 2 decades, West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus. Concerns regarding teratogenicity were raised about both viruses; Zika virus has been confirmed to be teratogenic, while WNV appears not to increase the risk for adverse outcomes, although teratogenicity has not been excluded. Study designs used to examine the effects of both viruses include case reports and series, pregnancy registries, and cohort studies. Case-control studies and birth defects surveillance systems are being used to study the effects during pregnancy of Zika virus, but not the effects of WNV, because a specific phenotype was observed among infants with congenital Zika infection, but not among infants with congenital WNV infection. Experimental data that demonstrated that Zika virus was neurotropic have also been useful because they provided biologic plausibility for Zika virus's teratogenic effects: these findings were consistent with observations in congenitally infected infants. Challenges encountered with studies to evaluate the effects of these infections include the broad range of possible adverse outcomes, the inability to include all infected pregnant women in studies because many infections are asymptomatic, and the difficulty with interpretation of diagnostic testing of infants (WNV and Zika) and pregnant women (Zika). This review might be helpful to guide future studies of the effects of emerging infections during pregnancy. Birth Defects Research 109:363-371, 2017.

A Literature Review of Zika Virus,"Plourde, A. R.; Bloch, E. M.","Zika virus is a mosquitoborne flavivirus that is the focus of an ongoing pandemic and public health emergency. Previously limited to sporadic cases in Africa and Asia, the emergence of Zika virus in Brazil in 2015 heralded rapid spread throughout the Americas. Although most Zika virus infections are characterized by subclinical or mild influenza-like illness, severe manifestations have been described, including Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults and microcephaly in babies born to infected mothers. Neither an effective treatment nor a vaccine is available for Zika virus; therefore, the public health response primarily focuses on preventing infection, particularly in pregnant women. Despite growing knowledge about this virus, questions remain regarding the virus's vectors and reservoirs, pathogenesis, genetic diversity, and potential synergistic effects of co-infection with other circulating viruses.

"Investigation Into an Outbreak of Dengue-like Illness in Pernambuco, Brazil, Revealed a Cocirculation of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue Virus Type 1","Pessoa, R.; Patriota, J. V.; Lourdes de Souza, Md; Felix, A. C.; Mamede, N.; Sanabani, S. S.","In April 2015, an outbreak of dengue-like illness occurred in Tuparetama, a small city in the northeast region of Brazil; this outbreak was characterized by its fast expansion. An investigation was initiated to identify the viral etiologies and advise the health authorities on implementing control measures to contain the outbreak. This is the first report of this outbreak in the northeast, even though a few cases were documented earlier in a neighboring city.Plasma samples were obtained from 77 suspected dengue patients attending the main hospital in the city. Laboratory assays, such as real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, virus cDNA sequencing, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were employed to identify the infecting virus and molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed to define the circulating viral genotypes.RNA of Zika virus (ZIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV) or IgM antibodies (Abs) to DENV or chikungunya (CHIKV) were detected in 40 of the 77 plasma samples (51.9%). DENV was found in 9 patients (11.7%), ZIKV was found in 31 patients (40.2%), CHIKV in 1 patient (1.3%), and coinfection of DENV and ZIKV was detected in 2 patients (2.6%). The phylogenetic analysis of 2 available partial DENV and 14 ZIKV sequences revealed the identities of genotype 1 and the Asiatic lineage, respectively.Consistent with recent reports from the same region, our results showed that the ongoing outbreak is caused by ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV. This emphasizes the need for a routine and differential diagnosis of arboviruses in patients with dengue-like illness. Coordinated efforts are necessary to contain the outbreak.

Persistence of Zika Virus in Body Fluids - Final Report,"Paz-Bailey, G.; Rosenberg, E. S.; Doyle, K.; Munoz-Jordan, J.; Santiago, G. A.; Klein, L.; Perez-Padilla, J.; Medina, F. A.; Waterman, S. H.; Gubern, C. G.; Alvarado, L. I.; Sharp, T. M.","BACKGROUND: To estimate the frequency and duration of detectable Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA in human body fluids, we prospectively assessed a cohort of newly infected participants in Puerto Rico. METHODS: We evaluated samples obtained from 150 participants (including 55 men) in whom ZIKV RNA was detected on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay in urine or blood in an enhanced arboviral clinical surveillance site. We collected serum, urine, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions weekly for the first month and then at 2, 4, and 6 months. All specimens were tested by means of RT-PCR, and serum was tested with the use of anti-ZIKV IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among the participants with ZIKV RNA in any specimen at week 4, biweekly collection continued until all specimens tested negative. We used parametric Weibull regression models to estimate the time until the loss of ZIKV RNA detection in each body fluid and reported the findings in medians and 95th percentiles. RESULTS: The medians and 95th percentiles for the time until the loss of ZIKV RNA detection were 14 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 11 to 17) and 54 days (95% CI, 43 to 64), respectively, in serum; 8 days (95% CI, 6 to 10) and 39 days (95% CI, 31 to 47) in urine; and 34 days (95% CI, 28 to 41) and 81 days (95% CI, 64 to 98) in semen. Few participants had detectable ZIKV RNA in saliva or vaginal secretions. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged time until ZIKV RNA clearance in serum in this study may have implications for the diagnosis and prevention of ZIKV infection. Current sexual-prevention guidelines recommend that men use condoms or abstain from sex for 6 months after ZIKV exposure; in 95% of the men in this study, ZIKV RNA was cleared from semen after about 3 months.

A.","BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been linked to the Guillain-Barre syndrome. From November 2015 through March 2016, clusters of cases of the Guillain-Barre syndrome were observed during the outbreak of ZIKV infection in Colombia. We characterized the clinical features of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome in the context of this ZIKV infection outbreak and investigated their relationship with ZIKV infection. METHODS: A total of 68 patients with the Guillain-Barre syndrome at six Colombian hospitals were evaluated clinically, and virologic studies were completed for 42 of the patients. We performed reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays for ZIKV in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine, as well as antiflavivirus antibody assays. RESULTS: A total of 66 patients (97%) had symptoms compatible with ZIKV infection before the onset of the Guillain-Barre syndrome. The median period between the onset of symptoms of ZIKV infection and symptoms of the Guillain-Barre syndrome was 7 days (interquartile range, 3 to 10). Among the 68 patients with the Guillain-Barre syndrome, 50% were found to have bilateral facial paralysis on examination. Among 46 patients in whom nerve-conduction studies and electromyography were performed, the results in 36 patients (78%) were consistent with the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy subtype of the Guillain-Barre syndrome. Among the 42 patients who had samples tested for ZIKV by RT-PCR, the results were positive in 17 patients (40%). Most of the positive RT-PCR results were in urine samples (in 16 of the 17 patients with positive RT-PCR results), although 3 samples of cerebrospinal fluid were also positive. In 18 of 42 patients (43%) with the Guillain-Barre syndrome who underwent laboratory testing, the presence of ZIKV infection was supported by clinical and immunologic findings. In 20 of these 42 patients (48%), the Guillain-Barre syndrome had a parainfectious onset. All patients tested were negative for dengue virus infection as assessed by RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence of ZIKV infection documented by RT-PCR among patients with the Guillain-Barre syndrome during the outbreak of ZIKV infection in Colombia lends support to the role of the infection in the development of the Guillain-Barre syndrome.

In Salvador, Brazil, outbreaks of acute exanthematous illness (AEI) attributed to Zika virus, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and microcephaly occurred in 2015. We investigated temporal correlations and time lags between these outbreaks to identify a common link between them by using epidemic curves and time series cross-correlations. Number of GBS cases peaked after a lag of 5-9 weeks from the AEI peak. Number of suspected cases of microcephaly peaked after a lag of 30-33 weeks from the AEI peak, which corresponded to time of potential infections of pregnant mothers during the first trimester. These findings support the association of GBS and microcephaly with Zika virus infection and provide evidence for a temporal relationship between timing of arboviral infection of pregnant women during the first trimester and birth outcome.",2016,Aug,Emerg Infect Dis,22,8,1438-44,27144515,10.3201/eid2208.160496,,#1369,Paploski 2016,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-11-30 02:20:16)(Included): Nothing to extract; ,

C.","OBJECTIVES: To describe salient epidemiological characteristics of Zika virus outbreaks across the world and to examine the clinical presentations, complications, and atypical manifestations related to their occurrence in recent history. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature by searching through MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health Library, as well as the epidemiological bulletins and alerts from the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control over the period 1954 to 2016. RESULTS: The search yielded 547 records. We retained 333 for further analysis, to which we added 11 epidemiological bulletins from various sources. Of these, we systematically reviewed 52 articles and reports, revealing some epidemiological features and patterns of spread of the Zika virus worldwide, as well as pathological outcomes suspected to be linked to Zika outbreaks. Neurologic disorders among zika patients were similar in Brazil and French Polynesia but a causal link is not established. Incidence of zika infection in pregnant women is not known. In Brazil, during the zika outbreak the incidence of microcephaly increased more than 20 times. Among 35 infants with microcephaly, born from women suspected to have Zika infection during pregnancy in northeast Brazil, 74% of the mothers reported rash during the first and second trimester. CONCLUSIONS: On February 1, 2016, The World Health Organization declared the ongoing Zika crisis an emergency and that, although not yet scientifically proven, the link between the virus and growing numbers of microcephaly cases was ""strongly suspected.""

Model-informed risk assessment for Zika virus outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific regions,"Teng, Y.; Bi, D.; Xie, G.; Jin, Y.; Huang, Y.; Lin, B.; An, X.; Tong, Y.; Feng, D.","Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) has been recognized as a significant threat to global public health. The disease was present in large parts of the Americas, the Caribbean, and also the western Pacific area with southern Asia during 2015 and 2016. However, little is known about the factors affecting the transmission of ZIKV. We used Gradient Boosted Regression Tree models to investigate the effects of various potential explanatory variables on the spread of ZIKV, and used current with historical information from a range of sources to assess the risks of future ZIKV outbreaks. Our results indicated that the probability of ZIKV outbreaks increases with vapor pressure, the occurrence of Dengue virus, and population density but decreases as health expenditure, GDP, and numbers of travelers. The predictive results revealed the potential risk countries of ZIKV infection in the Asia-Pacific regions between October 2016 and January 2017. We believe that the high-risk conditions would continue in South Asia and Australia over this period.

It was designed to provide Zika virus disease (ZVD) surveillance and detection for Health Departments, and predictive numbers of infection cases, which would allow them sufficient time to implement interventions. In this study, we found a strong correlation between Zika-related GTs and the cumulative numbers of reported cases (confirmed, suspected and total cases; p<0.001). Then, we used the correlation data from Zika-related online search in GTs and ZIKV epidemics between 12 February and 20 October 2016 to construct an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model (0, 1, 3) for the dynamic estimation of ZIKV outbreaks. The forecasting results indicated that the predicted data by ARIMA model, which used the online search data as the external regressor to enhance the forecasting model and assist the historical epidemic data in improving the quality of the predictions, are quite similar to the actual data during ZIKV epidemic early November 2016. Integer-valued autoregression provides a useful base predictive model for ZVD cases. This is enhanced by the incorporation of GTs data, confirming the prognostic utility of search query based surveillance.

Unless detected by RT-PCR, confirming an acute ZIKV infection can be challenging. We developed and validated a multiplexed flavivirus immunoglobulin M (IgM) microsphere immunoassay (flaviMIA) which can differentiate ZIKV-specific IgM from that due to other flavivirus infections in humans. The flaviMIA bound 12 inactivated flavivirus antigens, including those from ZIKV and yellow fever virus (YFV), to distinct anti-flavivirus antibody coupled beads. These beads were used to interrogate sera from patients with suspected ZIKV infection following travel to relevant countries. FlaviMIA results were validated by comparison to the ZIKV plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The results highlight the complexity of serological ZIKV diagnosis, particularly in patients previously exposed to or vaccinated against other flaviviruses. We confirmed 99 patients with ZIKV infection by a combination of RT-PCR and serology. Importantly, ZIKV antibodies could be discriminated from those ascribed to other flavivirus infections. Serological results were sometimes confounded by the presence of pre-existing antibodies attributed to previous flavivirus infection or vaccination.

A conceptual model for optimizing vaccine coverage to reduce vector-borne infections in the presence of antibody-dependent enhancement,"Tang, B.; Huo, X.; Xiao, Y.; Ruan, S.; Wu, J.","BACKGROUND: Many vector-borne diseases co-circulate, as the viruses from the same family are also transmitted by the same vector species. For example, Zika and dengue viruses belong to the same Flavivirus family and are primarily transmitted by a common mosquito species Aedes aegypti. Zika outbreaks have also commonly occurred in dengue-endemic areas, and co-circulation and co-infection of both viruses have been reported. As recent immunological cross-reactivity studies have confirmed that convalescent plasma following dengue infection can enhance Zika infection, and as global efforts of developing dengue and Zika vaccines are intensified, it is important to examine whether and how vaccination against one disease in a large population may affect infection dynamics of another disease due to antibody-dependent enhancement. METHODS: Through a conceptual co-infection dynamics model parametrized by reported dengue and Zika epidemic and immunological cross-reactivity characteristics, we evaluate impact of a hypothetical dengue vaccination program on Zika infection dynamics in a single season when only one particular dengue serotype is involved. RESULTS: We show that an appropriately designed and optimized dengue vaccination program can not only help control the dengue spread but also, counter-intuitively, reduce Zika infections. We identify optimal dengue vaccination coverages for controlling dengue and simultaneously reducing Zika infections, as well as the critical coverages exceeding which dengue vaccination will increase Zika infections. CONCLUSION: This study based on a conceptual model shows the promise of an integrative vector-borne disease control strategy involving optimal vaccination programs, in regions where different viruses or different serotypes of the same virus co-circulate, and convalescent plasma following infection from one virus (serotype) can enhance infection against another virus (serotype).

Potential occurrence of Zika from subtropical to temperate Argentina considering the basic reproduction number (R0),"Orellano, P.; Vezzani, D.; Quaranta, N.; Cionco, R.; Reynoso, J.; Salomon, O.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential occurrence of Zika transmission throughout Argentina by the mosquito Aedes aegypti considering the basic reproduction number (R0). METHODS: A model originally developed for dengue was adapted for Zika. R0 was estimated as a function of seven parameters, three of them were considered temperature-dependent. Seasonal Zika occurrence was evaluated in 9 locations representing different climatic suitability for the vector. Data of diary temperatures were extracted and included in the model. A threshold of R0 = 1 was fixed for Zika occurrence. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the uncertainty around the results. RESULTS: Zika transmission has the potential to occur in all studied locations at least in some moment of the year. In the northern region, transmission might be possible throughout the whole year or with an interruption in winter. The maximum R0 was estimated in 6.9, which means an average of 7 secondary cases from a primary case. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that during winter the transmission can only be excluded in the southern fringe of geographic distribution of the vector and in part of central Argentina. CONCLUSION: Zika virus has the potential to be transmitted in Argentina throughout the current geographic range of the mosquito vector. Although the transmission would be mainly seasonal, the possibility of winter transmission cannot be excluded in northern and central Argentina, meaning that there is a potential endemic maintenance of the disease.",2018,Feb-19,Rev Panam Salud Publica,41,,e120,29466517,,,#1507,Orellano 2018,"Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-04-12 20:52:51)(Included): After double extraction reconciliation, Patrick and I both decided to push this paper back - due to having nothing to extract.; ",

Sexually acquired Zika virus: a systematic review,"Moreira, J.; Peixoto, T. M.; Siqueira, A. M.; Lamas, C. C.","BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes mosquito bites. However, circumstantial evidence points to a sexual transmission route. OBJECTIVES: To assess the sexually acquired ZIKV cases and to investigate the shedding of ZIKV in genital fluids. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, Pro-MED-mail and WHO ZIKV notification databases from inception to December 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Reports describing ZIKV acquisition through sex and studies reporting the detection or isolation of ZIKV in the genital fluids were included. RISK-OF-BIAS ASSESSMENT: The risk of bias was assessed using the National Institute of Health Tool. RESULTS: Eighteen studies reporting on sex-acquired ZIKV and 21 describing the presence of ZIKV in genital fluids were included. The overall risk of bias was moderate. Sexual transmission was male-female (92.5%), female-male (3.7%) and male-male (3.7%). Modes of sexual transmission were unprotected vaginal (96.2%), oral (18.5%) and anal (7.4%) intercourse. The median time between onset of symptoms in the index partner and presumed sexual transmission was 13 days (range 4-44 days). ZIKV RNA was detected in semen as late as 188 days (range 3-188 days) following symptom onset, and infectious virus was isolated in semen up to 69 days after symptom onset. No study reported ZIKV isolation from female genital samples, but detection did occur up to 13 days after symptom onset.

We use mechanistic transmission models to derive predictions for how the probability and magnitude of transmission for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue change with mean temperature, and we show that these predictions are well matched by human case data. Across all three viruses, models and human case data both show that transmission occurs between 18-34 degrees C with maximal transmission occurring in a range from 26-29 degrees C. Controlling for population size and two socioeconomic factors, temperature-dependent transmission based on our mechanistic model is an important predictor of human transmission occurrence and incidence. Risk maps indicate that tropical and subtropical regions are suitable for extended seasonal or year-round transmission, but transmission in temperate areas is limited to at most three months per year even if vectors are present.

In this work, we used data from 11 locations with publicly available data to estimate the risk of GBS following an infection with Zika virus, as well as the location-specific incidence of infection and the number of suspect GBS cases reported per infection. METHODS: We built a mathematical inference framework utilizing data from 11 locations that had reported suspect Zika and GBS cases, two with completed outbreaks prior to 2015 (French Polynesia and Yap) and nine others in the Americas covering partial outbreaks and where transmission was ongoing as of early 2017. RESULTS: We estimated that 2.0 (95% credible interval 0.5-4.5) reported GBS cases may occur per 10,000 Zika virus infections. The frequency of reported suspect Zika cases varied substantially and was highly uncertain, with a mean of 0.11 (95% credible interval 0.01-0.24) suspect cases reported per infection.

"Epidemiology of Zika virus, 1947-2007","Posen, H. J.; Keystone, J. S.; Gubbay, J. B.; Morris, S. K.","INTRODUCTION: Since 1947, Zika virus has been identified sporadically in humans in Africa and Asia; however, clinically consequential Zika virus disease had not been documented prior to the current outbreak in the Americas. Considering 6 decades have passed since the first identification of the virus, it is perhaps unexpected that Zika virus was recognised only recently as capable of causing disease epidemics. Substantial work on understanding the epidemiology of Zika virus has been conducted since the virus' first outbreak in 2007 in Micronesia; however, there has been little study of the earlier data on Zika virus. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify evidence of Zika virus infection in humans from 1947 to 2007. Data extracted included seroprevalence of Zika virus infection, age distributions of positive test results and serologic test modalities used. Country-level and age-specific seroprevalence was calculated. Estimates of seroprevalence by different serologic test modalities were compared. RESULTS: 12 026 citations were retrieved by the literature search, and 76 articles were included in this review. Evidence of Zika virus infection in humans was found in 29 countries in Africa, 8 countries in Asia and 1 country in Europe. Country-level seroprevalence of Zika virus infection ranged from 0.4% to 53.3%. Seroprevalence of Zika virus infection was found to increase across the lifespan; 15-40% of reproductive-age individuals may have been previously infected. No significant difference was found between estimates of seroprevalence by different serologic test modalities. DISCUSSION: Zika virus has likely been endemic for decades in certain regions of the world; however, the majority of reproductive-age individuals have likely not been infected. Historical evidence of Zika virus infection exists regardless of the serologic test modality used.",2016,,BMJ Glob Health,1,2,e000087,28588942,10.1136/bmjgh-2016-000087,,#1762,Posen 2016,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractorá (2019-10-31 23:51:53)(Select): Useful sero-prevalence studies; ,Review
A Zika virus from America is more efficiently transmitted than an Asian virus by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from Asia,"Pompon, J.; Morales-Vargas, R.; Manuel, M.; Huat Tan, C.; Vial, T.; Hao Tan, J.; Sessions, O.

The first outbreak was recorded in Micronesia in 2007, then in French Polynesia in 2014 from which it spread to South America in 2015 and ignited a widespread epidemic. Interestingly, Zika outbreaks in Asia remained of moderate intensity although the virus is circulating. To understand these epidemiological variations, we investigated the entomological determinants of ZIKV transmission in Asia. We used oral infection of mosquitoes collected in Singapore to identify the vector species, to quantify the blood infection threshold and to compare transmissibility between an Asian ZIKV strain (H/PF13) and an American strain collected in Brazil (BE H 815744). We have confirmed the vector status of Aedes aegypti and determined that 10(3) pfu/ml of blood is sufficient to infect mosquitoes.

METHODS: We studied adults who had developed a new neurological condition following suspected Zika virus infection between 1st November 2015 and 1st June 2016. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, and urine were tested for evidence of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses. RESULTS: Of 35 patients studied, 22 had evidence of recent arboviral infection. Twelve had positive PCR or IgM for Zika, five of whom also had evidence for chikungunya, three for dengue, and one for all three viruses. Five of them presented with GBS; seven had presentations other than GBS, including meningoencephalitis, myelitis, radiculitis or combinations of these syndromes. Additionally, ten patients positive for chikungunya virus, two of whom also had evidence for dengue virus, presented with a similar range of neurological conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Zika virus is associated with a wide range of neurological manifestations, including central nervous system disease. Chikungunya virus appears to have an equally important association with neurological disease in Brazil, and many patients had dual infection.

"Forecasting Zika Incidence in the 2016 Latin America Outbreak Combining Traditional Disease Surveillance with Search, Social Media, and News Report Data","McGough, S. F.; Brownstein, J. S.; Hawkins, J. B.; Santillana, M.","BACKGROUND: Over 400,000 people across the Americas are thought to have been infected with Zika virus as a consequence of the 2015-2016 Latin American outbreak. Official government-led case count data in Latin America are typically delayed by several weeks, making it difficult to track the disease in a timely manner. Thus, timely disease tracking systems are needed to design and assess interventions to mitigate disease transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We combined information from Zika-related Google searches, Twitter microblogs, and the HealthMap digital surveillance system with historical Zika suspected case counts to track and predict estimates of suspected weekly Zika cases during the 2015-2016 Latin American outbreak, up to three weeks ahead of the publication of official case data. We evaluated the predictive power of these data and used a dynamic multivariable approach to retrospectively produce predictions of weekly suspected cases for five countries: Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela, and Martinique. Models that combined Google (and Twitter data where available) with autoregressive information showed the best out-of-sample predictive accuracy for 1-week ahead predictions, whereas models that used only Google and Twitter typically performed best for 2- and 3-week ahead predictions. SIGNIFICANCE: Given the significant delay in the release of official government-reported Zika case counts, we show that these Internet-based data streams can be used as timely and complementary ways to assess the dynamics of the outbreak.",2017,Jan,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,11,1,e0005295,28085877,10.1371/journal.pntd.0005295,,#1796,McGough 2017,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

J.; Perez-Padilla, J.; Jamieson, D. J.; Honein, M. A.; Shapiro-Mendoza, C. K.","BACKGROUND: Since the Zika virus epidemic in the Americas began in 2015, Zika virus transmission has occurred throughout the Americas. However, limited information exists regarding possible risks of transmission of Zika virus and other flaviviruses through breast feeding and human milk. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence regarding flaviviruses detection in and transmission through milk, specifically regarding Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Powassan virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Popline, Virtual Health Library, and WorldCat were searched through June 2017. Two authors independently screened potential studies for inclusion and extracted data. Human and nonhuman (animal) studies describing: 1) confirmed or suspected cases of mother-to-child transmission through milk; or 2) the presence of flavivirus genomic material in milk. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included, four animal models and thirteen observational studies. Dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Zika virus viral ribonucleic acid was detected in human milk, including infectious Zika virus and dengue virus viral particles. Human breast-feeding transmission was confirmed for only yellow fever virus. There was evidence of milk-related transmission of dengue virus, Powassan virus, and West Nile virus in animal studies. CONCLUSIONS: Because the health advantages of breast feeding are considered greater than the potential risk of transmission, the World Health Organization recommends that mothers with possible or confirmed Zika virus infection or exposure continue to breast feed.

M.; Rivera-Garcia, B.","OBJECTIVE: Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon autoimmune disorder that follows infection or vaccination, and increased incidence has been reported during Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission. During the 2016 ZIKV epidemic, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) implemented the Enhanced GBS Surveillance System (EGBSSS). Here, we describe EGBSSS implementation and evaluate completeness, validity, and timeliness. METHODS: GBS cases were identified using passive surveillance and discharge diagnostic code for GBS. Completeness was evaluated by capture-recapture methods. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for confirmed GBS cases were calculated for both case identification methods. Median time to completion of key time steps were compared by quarter (Q1-4) and hospital size. RESULTS: A total of 122 confirmed GBS cases with onset of neurologic illness in 2016 were identified. Capture-recapture methodology estimated that four confirmed GBS cases were missed by both identification methods. Identification of cases by diagnostic code had a higher sensitivity than passive surveillance (89% vs. 80%), but a lower PPV (60% vs. 72%). There was a significant decrease from Q1 to Q3 in median time from hospital admission to case reporting (11 days vs. 2 days, p = 0.032) and from Q2 to Q3 in median time from specimen receipt to arbovirus laboratory test reporting (35 days vs. 26 days, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: EGBSSS provided complete, valid, and increasingly timely surveillance data, which guided public health action and supported healthcare providers during the ZIKV epidemic.

Risk of Zika virus transmission by blood donations in Brazil,"Magnus, M. M.; Esposito, D. L. A.; Costa, V. A. D.; Melo, P. S.; Costa-Lima, C.; Fonseca, Bald; Addas-Carvalho, M.","Background: Zika, a disease caused by Zika virus infections, has recently emerged and caused outbreaks in many parts of the world. The clinical manifestations of Zika are usually mild, mostly presenting as an exanthematic febrile disease, but on some occasions, it might be associated with microcephaly after intrauterine infection, and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Zika virus is primarily transmitted by mosquito bites, but other means of transmission have been described, and potential risk for blood transmission has been reported in French Polynesia and Brazil. Methods: To investigate the risk of Zika virus infection after a blood transfusion in an area of Brazil where a possible transmission by a platelet concentrate has been described. Using a mini-pool format, 1857 blood donations were evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction designed to detect Zika virus RNA. Results: After testing samples individually from positive mini-pools, the prevalence of Zika virus RNA was only 0.16%, a result probably associated to the low circulation of this virus in the study area. In addition, it was evident that the implementation of post-surveillance programs is important to detect Zika virus infections in blood donors, as the post-donation surveillance program detected two blood donors with the disease in this study. Conclusion: This study shows that the risk for Zika virus transmission by blood transfusion is real, even in regions with a low circulation of the disease, but the combination of the detection of Zika virus RNA by polymerase chain reaction and post-donation surveillance might reduce the risk of transmission by blood transfusions.",2018,Jul-Sep,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther,40,3,250-254,30128434,10.1016/j.htct.2018.01.011,,#1872,Magnus 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

A.","BACKGROUND: Several arboviruses, including dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, circulate in northeast Brazil. Diseases caused by these viruses are of great public health relevance, however, their epidemiological features in areas where the three viruses co-circulate are scarce. Here, we present analyses of molecular and serological diagnostics in a prospective study of acute febrile patients recruited from May 2015 to May 2016 in Recife, Brazil. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-three acute febrile patients with symptoms suggestive of an arboviral disease who attended an urgent heath care clinic in the Recife Metropolitan Region in northeast Brazil were enrolled. Acute and convalescent blood samples were collected and tested using molecular and serological assays for infection with DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV. RESULTS: Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (qRTPCR) performed on acute phase sera detected no patients positive for DENV, but 26 (9.9%) positive for ZIKV and 132 (50.2%) positive for CHIKV. There were a few suspected and only one confirmed dengue case. Specific serological assays for ZIKV and CHIKV confirmed the qRTPCR data. Analyses of DENV IgM and IgG ELISAs in the context of qRTPCR results suggested high levels of cross reactive antibodies in ZIKV-positive samples. Results from neutralization assays highly corroborated those from qRTPCR and ZIKV ELISA, indicating very few positive DENV cases. ZIKV infections were temporally clustered in the first months of the study and started to decrease concomitantly with an increase in CHIKV infections in August 2015. The proportion of CHIKV infections increased significantly in September 2015 and remained high until the end of the study period, with an average of 84.7% of recruited patients being diagnosed from August 2015 to May 2016. ZIKV infections exhibited a female bias and the cases were spread over the study site, while CHIKV cases had a male bias and were spatially clustered in each month. CONCLUSIONS: In 2015-2016 in the Recife Metropolitan Region, we detected the tail end of a Zika epidemic, which was displaced by a chikungunya epidemic. Few dengue cases were identified despite a high number of official dengue notifications in the area during this period.

Modeling the spread of the Zika virus using topological data analysis,"Lo, D.; Park, B.","Zika virus (ZIKV), a disease spread primarily through the Aedes aegypti mosquito, was identified in Brazil in 2015 and was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). Epidemiologists often use common state-level attributes such as population density and temperature to determine the spread of disease. By applying techniques from topological data analysis, we believe that epidemiologists will be able to better predict how ZIKV will spread. We use the Vietoris-Rips filtration on high-density mosquito locations in Brazil to create simplicial complexes, from which we extract homology group generators. Previously epidemiologists have not relied on topological data analysis to model disease spread.

C.; Hills, S. L.","Cross-reactivity within flavivirus antibody assays, produced by shared epitopes in the envelope proteins, can complicate the serological diagnosis of Zika virus (ZIKAV) infection. We assessed the utility of the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to confirm recent ZIKAV infections and rule out misleading positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) results in areas with various levels of past dengue virus (DENV) infection incidence. We reviewed PRNT results of sera collected for diagnosis of ZIKAV infection from 1 January through 31 August 2016 with positive ZIKAV IgM results, and ZIKAV and DENV PRNTs were performed. PRNT result interpretations included ZIKAV, unspecified flavivirus, DENV infection, or negative. For this analysis, ZIKAV IgM was considered false positive for samples interpreted as a DENV infection or negative. In U.S. states, 208 (27%) of 759 IgM-positive results were confirmed to be ZIKAV compared to 11 (21%) of 52 in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), 15 (15%) of 103 in American Samoa, and 13 (11%) of 123 in Puerto Rico. In American Samoa and Puerto Rico, more than 80% of IgM-positive results were unspecified flavivirus infections. The false-positivity rate was 27% in U.S. states, 18% in the USVI, 2% in American Samoa, and 6% in Puerto Rico. In U.S. states, the PRNT provided a virus-specific diagnosis or ruled out infection in the majority of IgM-positive samples. Almost a third of ZIKAV IgM-positive results were not confirmed; therefore, providers and patients must understand that IgM results are preliminary.

The present study aimed to estimate a theoretical risk of microcephaly during pregnancy with ZIKV infection in Northeastern Brazil in 2015. METHODS: Temporal distributions of microcephaly, reported dengue-like illness and dengue seropositive in Brazil were extracted from secondary data sources. Using an integral equation model and a backcalculation technique, we estimated the risk of microcephaly during pregnancy with Zika virus infection. RESULTS: If the fraction of Zika virus infections among a total of seronegative dengue-like illness cases is 30%, the risk of microcephaly following infection during the first trimester was estimated at 46.7% (95% CI: 9.1, 84.2), comparable to the risk of congenital rubella syndrome. However, the risk of microcephaly was shown to vary widely from 14.0% to 100%. The mean gestational age at delivery with microcephaly was estimated at 37.5 weeks (95% CI: 36.9, 39.3).

Zika: An enormous public health challenge for a miniscule virus,"Mustafa, M. S.; Ramasethu, R.","Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has recently affected 4 million people across the globe. The World Health Organization has declared Zika a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"". The disease is caused by an arbovirus and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Zika has followed a pattern already set in by Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. The virus exists in sylvatic form with spillovers to humans. The present outbreak in Brazil started in May 2015 and spread rapidly to Latin America and the Caribbean. The rapid spread is due to availability of non-immune population. The main concern of Zika is the association with microcephaly in infants and Guillain-Barre (GB) Syndrome. During the current Zika outbreak in Brazil, incidence of microcephaly in infants has shown a 20-fold rise. Increased incidence of GB Syndrome has been noticed during the 2013 outbreak in French Polynesia, and the current outbreak. However, causality has not been proved. It is possible that the ZIKV may enter and get established in India. Surveillance against the disease needs to be scaled up.

The infection also affected Guangdong province, which is located in southern China. Multiple factors, including frequent communication with South America and Southeast Asia, suitable climate (sub-tropical) for the habitat of Aedes species, may increase the risk of ZIKV disease transmission in this region. METHODS: An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was used to develop a semi-quantitative ZIKV risk assessment model. After selecting indicators, we invited experts in related professions to identify the index weight and based on that a hierarchical structure was generated. Then a series of pairwise comparisons were used to determine the relative importance of the criteria. Finally, the optimal model was established to estimate the spatial and seasonal transmission risk of ZIKV. RESULTS: A total of 15 factors that potentially influenced the risk of ZIKV transmission were identified. The factor that received the largest weight was epidemic of ZIKV in Guangdong province (combined weight [CW] =0.37), followed by the mosquito density (CW = 0.18) and the epidemic of DENV in Guangdong province (CW = 0.14).

METHODS: Data relating to five arboviral diseases (Zika, dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever (RVF)) were extracted from some of the largest contemporary databases and paired with data on the known distribution of their vectors, A. aegypti and A. albopictus. The disease occurrence data for the selected diseases were compiled from literature dating as far back as 1952 to as recent as 2017. The resulting datasets were aggregated at the country level, except in the case of the USA, where state-level data were used. Spatial analysis was used to process the data and to develop risk maps. RESULTS: Out of the 250 countries/territories considered, 215 (86%) are potentially suitable for the survival and establishment of A. aegypti and/or A. albopictus. A. albopictus has suitability foci in 197 countries/territories, while there are 188 that are suitable for A. aegypti. There is considerable variation in the suitability range among countries/territories, but many of the tropical regions of the world provide high suitability over extensive areas. Globally, 146 (58.4%) countries/territories reported at least one arboviral disease, while 123 (49.2%) reported more than one of the above diseases. The overall numbers of countries/territories reporting autochthonous vector-borne occurrences of Zika, dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and RVF, were 85, 111, 106, 43, and 39, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With 215 countries/territories potentially suitable for the most important arboviral disease vectors and more than half of these reporting cases, arboviral diseases are indeed a global public health threat. The increasing proportion of reports that include multiple arboviral diseases highlights the expanding range of their common transmission vectors.

Times to key events in Zika virus infection and implications for blood donation: a systematic review,"Lessler, J.; Ott, C. T.; Carcelen, A. C.; Konikoff, J. M.; Williamson, J.; Bi, Q.; Kucirka, L. M.; Cummings, D. A.; Reich, N. G.; Chaisson, L. H.","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the timing of key events in the natural history of Zika virus infection. METHODS: In February 2016, we searched PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science for publications containing the term Zika. By pooling data, we estimated the incubation period, the time to seroconversion and the duration of viral shedding. We estimated the risk of Zika virus contaminated blood donations. FINDINGS: We identified 20 articles on 25 patients with Zika virus infection. The median incubation period for the infection was estimated to be 5.9 days (95% credible interval, CrI: 4.4-7.6), with 95% of people who developed symptoms doing so within 11.2 days (95% CrI: 7.6-18.0) after infection. On average, seroconversion occurred 9.1 days (95% CrI: 7.0-11.6) after infection. The virus was detectable in blood for 9.9 days (95% CrI: 6.9-21.4) on average. Without screening, the estimated risk that a blood donation would come from an infected individual increased by approximately 1 in 10 000 for every 1 per 100 000 person-days increase in the incidence of Zika virus infection. Symptom-based screening may reduce this rate by 7% (relative risk, RR: 0.93; 95% CrI: 0.89-0.99) and antibody screening, by 29% (RR: 0.71; 95% CrI: 0.28-0.88).

A Compartmental Model for Zika Virus with Dynamic Human and Vector Populations,"Lee, E. K.; Liu, Y.; Pietz, F. H.","The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in South American countries and its potential association with microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barre Syndrome led the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To understand the ZIKV disease dynamics and evaluate the effectiveness of different containment strategies, we propose a compartmental model with a vector-host structure for ZIKV. The model utilizes logistic growth in human population and dynamic growth in vector population. Using this model, we derive the basic reproduction number to gain insight on containment strategies. We contrast the impact and influence of different parameters on the virus trend and outbreak spread. We also evaluate different containment strategies and their combination effects to achieve early containment by minimizing total infections. This result can help decision makers select and invest in the strategies most effective to combat the infection spread.

Zika Virus Infection as a Cause of Congenital Brain Abnormalities and Guillain-Barre Syndrome: Systematic Review,"Krauer, F.; Riesen, M.; Reveiz, L.; Oladapo, O. T.; Martinez-Vega, R.; Porgo, T. V.; Haefliger, A.; Broutet, N. J.; Low, N.","BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) stated in March 2016 that there was scientific consensus that the mosquito-borne Zika virus was a cause of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and of microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities based on rapid evidence assessments. Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were to update and reassess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and (a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and (b) GBS in any population, and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in ten dimensions: temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response relationship, animal experiments, analogy, specificity, and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, WHO convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts who assessed the review findings and reached consensus statements to update the WHO position on causality. We found 1,091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of ten causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity), we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For GBS, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity, and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified nonsystematically from May 30 to July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that (a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly, and (b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and GBS is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of GBS. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or GBS but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible cofactors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge. This systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of GBS.",2017,Jan,PLoS Med,14,1,e1002203,28045901,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002203,,#2370,Krauer 2017,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

Estimated Zika virus importations to Europe by travellers from Brazil,"Massad, E.; Tan, S.

The extent of spread depends on the travel volume and the endemicity in the exporting country. In the absence of reliable surveillance data, we did mathematical modelling to estimate the number of importations of ZIKV from Brazil into Europe. DESIGN: We applied a previously developed mathematical model on importations of dengue to estimate the number of ZIKV importations into Europe, based on the travel volume, the probability of being infected at the time of travel, the population size of Brazil, and the estimated incidence of ZIKV infections. RESULTS: Our model estimated between 508 and 1,778 imported infections into Europe in 2016, of which we would expect between 116 and 355 symptomatic Zika infections; with the highest number of importations being into France, Portugal and Italy. CONCLUSIONS: Our model identified high-risk countries in Europe.

Assessing likely invasion sites of Zika virus-infected mosquitoes in civilian and naval maritime ports in Florida,"Kollars, T. M.","Several mosquito species are capable of invading new geographic regions and exploiting niches that are similar to their natural home ranges where they may introduce, or reintroduce, pathogens. In addition to initial invasion, introduction of new genotypes into established populations may also occur. Zika virus is spreading throughout the world, posing significant health risks to human populations, particularly pregnant women and their infants. The first locally acquired case of Zika virus in the US occurred in July 2016 in Miami, Florida on the Atlantic coast; the first locally acquired case in another US county occurred in the Tampa, Florida area. Three port cities in Florida were chosen to assess the risk of import and spread of Zika virus: Mayport Naval Station, Miami, and Tampa. The bioagent transport and enviromental modeling system TIGER model and ArcGIS were used to analyze abiotic and biotic factors influencing potentially Zika-infected Aedes species, should they enter through these ports. The model was tested by overlaying documented and suspected concurrent Zika cases and comparing published high-risk areas for Zika virus. In addition to Zika hot zones being identified, output indicates surveillance and integrated mosquito management should expect larger zones. Surveillance sites at ports should be identified and prioritized for pathogen and vector control to reduce the import of mosquitoes infected with Zika virus. Low resolution maps often provide valuable suitability of the geographic expansion of organisms. Providing a higher resolution predictive map, identifying probable routes of invasion, and providing areas at high risk for initial invasion and control zones, will aid in controlling and perhaps eliminating the spread of arboviruses through mosquito vectors.",2017,,Res Rep Trop Med,8,,01-Jun,30050340,10.2147/rrtm.s123456,,#2467,Kollars 2017,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

C.","The increasing dengue burden and epidemic severity worldwide have highlighted the need to improve surveillance. In non-endemic areas such as Taiwan, where outbreaks start mostly with imported cases from Southeast Asia, a closer examination of surveillance dynamics to detect cases early is necessary. To evaluate problems with dengue surveillance and investigate the involvement of different factors at various epidemic stages, we investigated 632 laboratory-confirmed indigenous dengue cases in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan during 2009-2010. The estimated sensitivity of clinical surveillance was 82.4% (521/632). Initially, the modified serological surveillance (targeting only the contacts of laboratory-confirmed dengue cases) identified clinically unrecognized afebrile cases in younger patients who visited private clinics and accounted for 30.4% (35/115) of the early-stage cases. Multivariate regression indicated that hospital/medical center visits [Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 11.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.3-21.4], middle epidemic stage [aOR: 2.4 (1.2-4.7)], fever [aOR: 2.3 (2.3-12.9)], and musculo-articular pain [aOR: 1.9 (1.05-3.3)] were significantly associated with clinical reporting. However, cases with pruritus/rash [aOR: 0.47 (0.26-0.83)] and diarrhea [aOR: 0.47 (0.26-0.85)] were underreported. In conclusion, multiple factors contributed to dengue surveillance problems. To prevent a large-scale epidemic and minimize severe dengue cases, there is a need for integrated surveillance incorporating entomological, clinical, serological, and virological surveillance systems to detect early cases, followed by immediate prevention and control measures and continuous evaluation to ensure effectiveness. This effort will be particularly important for an arbovirus, such as Zika virus, with a high asymptomatic infection ratio. For dengue- non-endemic countries, we recommend serological surveillance be implemented in areas with high Aedes mosquito indices or many breeding sites.

Mapping the transmission risk of Zika virus using machine learning models,"Jiang, D.; Hao, M.; Ding, F.; Fu, J.; Li, M.","Zika virus, which has been linked to severe congenital abnormalities, is exacerbating global public health problems with its rapid transnational expansion fueled by increased global travel and trade. Suitability mapping of the transmission risk of Zika virus is essential for drafting public health plans and disease control strategies, which are especially important in areas where medical resources are relatively scarce. Predicting the risk of Zika virus outbreak has been studied in recent years, but the published literature rarely includes multiple model comparisons or predictive uncertainty analysis. Here, three relatively popular machine learning models including backward propagation neural network (BPNN), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and random forest (RF) were adopted to map the probability of Zika epidemic outbreak at the global level, pairing high-dimensional multidisciplinary covariate layers with comprehensive location data on recorded Zika virus infection in humans. The results show that the predicted high-risk areas for Zika transmission are concentrated in four regions: Southeastern North America, Eastern South America, Central Africa and Eastern Asia. To evaluate the performance of machine learning models, the 50 modeling processes were conducted based on a training dataset. The BPNN model obtained the highest predictive accuracy with a 10-fold cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) of 0.966 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.965-0.967], followed by the GBM model (10-fold cross-validation AUC=0.964[0.963-0.965]) and the RF model (10-fold cross-validation AUC=0.963[0.962-0.964]). Based on training samples, compared with the BPNN-based model, we find that significant differences (p=0.0258* and p=0.0001***, respectively) are observed for prediction accuracies achieved by the GBM and RF models. Importantly, the prediction uncertainty introduced by the selection of absence data was quantified and could provide more accurate fundamental and scientific information for further study on disease transmission prediction and risk assessment.",2018,Sep,Acta Trop,185,,391-399,29932934,10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.06.021,,#2591,Jiang 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

"Risk of microcephaly after Zika virus infection in Brazil, 2015 to 2016","Jaenisch, T.; Rosenberger, K. D.; Brito, C.; Brady, O.; Brasil, P.; Marques, E. T.","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risk of microcephaly in babies born to women infected by the Zika virus during pregnancy in Brazil in an epidemic between 2015 and 2016. METHODS: We obtained data on the number of notified and confirmed microcephaly cases in each Brazilian state between November 2015 and October 2016 from the health ministry. For Pernambuco State, one of the hardest hit, weekly data were available from August 2015 to October 2016 for different definitions of microcephaly. The absolute risk of microcephaly was calculated using the average number of live births reported in each state in the corresponding time period between 2012 and 2014 and assuming two infection rates: 10% and 50%. The relative risk was estimated using the reported background frequency of microcephaly in Brazil of 1.98 per 10 000 live births. FINDINGS: The estimated absolute risk of a notified microcephaly case varied from 0.03 to 17.1% according to geographical area, the definition of microcephaly used and the infection rate. Assuming a 50% infection rate, there was an 18-127 fold higher probability of microcephaly in children born to mothers with infection during pregnancy compared with children born to mothers without infection during pregnancy in Pernambuco State. For a 10% infection rate, the probability was 88-635 folds higher. CONCLUSION: A large variation in the estimated risk of microcephaly was found in Brazil.

Current Zika virus epidemiology and recent epidemics,"Ioos, S.; Mallet, H. P.; Leparc Goffart, I.; Gauthier, V.; Cardoso, T.; Herida, M.","The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus (Aedes), similar to other arboviruses, first identified in Uganda in 1947. Few human cases were reported until 2007, when a Zika outbreak occurred in Yap, Micronesia, even though ZIKV activity had been reported in Africa and in Asia through virological surveillance and entomological studies. French Polynesia has recorded a large outbreak since October 2013. A great number of cases and some with neurological and autoimmune complications have been reported in a context of concurrent circulation of dengue viruses. The clinical presentation is a ""dengue-like syndrome"". Until the epidemic in French Polynesia, no severe ZIKV disease had been described so far. The diagnosis is confirmed by viral genome detection by genomic amplification (RT- PCR) and viral isolation. These two large outbreaks occurred in a previously unaffected area in less than a decade. They should raise awareness as to the potential for ZIKV to spread especially since this emergent disease is not well known and that some questions remain on potential reservoirs and transmission modes as well as on clinical presentations and complications. ZIKV has the potential to spread to new areas where the Aedes mosquito vector is present and could be a risk for Southern Europe.

In response, in May 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which serves as the Regional Office of the Americas for the World Health Organization (WHO), issued recommendations to enhance surveillance for Zika virus. Subsequently, Brazilian investigators reported Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), which had been previously recognized among some patients with Zika virus disease, and identified an association between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and congenital microcephaly (2). On February 1, 2016, WHO declared Zika virus-related microcephaly clusters and other neurologic disorders a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.* In March 2016, PAHO developed case definitions and surveillance guidance for Zika virus disease and associated complications (3). Analysis of reports submitted to PAHO by countries in the region or published in national epidemiologic bulletins revealed that Zika virus transmission had extended to 48 countries and territories in the Region of the Americas by late 2016.

Zika virus in semen: a prospective cohort study of symptomatic travellers returning to Belgium,"Huits, R.; De Smet, B.; Arien, K. K.; Van Esbroeck, M.; Bottieau, E.; Cnops, L.","Objective: To prospectively monitor Zika viral loads in semen from Belgian travellers with confirmed Zika virus infection, who returned from the Americas during the 2016 Zika virus epidemic. Methods: We recruited symptomatic travellers consulting our clinic and we confirmed infection with either reverse-transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or virus neutralization test. The participants produced semen samples weekly, either at the clinic or at home. For the initial sample, the laboratory staff did a microscopy analysis if they received the sample within an hour of production. Using RT-PCR, we monitored Zika virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) loads in semen until we obtained two negative results. Findings: We detected Zika virus RNA in nine of 15 participants' semen, one of whom was vasectomized. The median time to loss of RNA detection in semen was 83 days after symptom onset (95% confidence interval, CI: 57-108). The longest duration of viral shedding in semen before obtaining the first negative RT-PCR result was 144 days after symptom onset. All of the 11 participants, for whom we microscopically analysed their semen, had presence of leukocytes, 10 showed haematospermia and six showed oligospermia. These abnormalities occurred irrespective of Zika virus detection in semen. Conclusion: The majority of men in our study had detectable Zika virus RNA in their semen.

V.","The first patients with laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus disease in American Samoa had symptom onset in January 2016 (1). In response, the American Samoa Department of Health (ASDoH) implemented mosquito control measures (1), strategies to protect pregnant women (1), syndromic surveillance based on electronic health record (EHR) reports (1), Zika virus testing of persons with one or more signs or symptoms of Zika virus disease (fever, rash, arthralgia, or conjunctivitis) (1-3), and routine testing of all asymptomatic pregnant women in accordance with CDC guidance (2,3)(.) All collected blood and urine specimens were shipped to the Hawaii Department of Health Laboratory for Zika virus testing and to CDC for confirmatory testing. Early in the response, collection and testing of specimens from pregnant women was prioritized over the collection from symptomatic nonpregnant patients because of limited testing and shipping capacity. The weekly numbers of suspected Zika virus disease cases declined from an average of six per week in January-February 2016 to one per week in May 2016. By August, the EHR-based syndromic surveillance (1) indicated a return to pre-outbreak levels. The last Zika virus disease case detected by real-time, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) occurred in a patient who had symptom onset on June 19, 2016. In August 2016, ASDoH requested CDC support in assessing whether local transmission had been reduced or interrupted and in proposing a timeline for discontinuation of routine testing of asymptomatic pregnant women. An end date (October 15, 2016) was determined for active mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus and a timeline was developed for discontinuation of routine screening of asymptomatic pregnant women in American Samoa (conception after December 10, 2016, with permissive testing for asymptomatic women who conceive through April 15, 2017).",2017,Mar-24,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,66,11,299-301,28333910,10.15585/mmwr.mm6611a5,,#2741,Hancock 2017,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,

Methods: We searched PubMed(R), Embase(R) and LILACS online databases from inception to 26 January 2018. We included observational epidemiological studies where laboratory testing was used to confirm positive exposure of participants to Zika virus and in which Zika virus symptom status was also recorded. We excluded studies in which having symptoms of Zika virus was a criterion for inclusion. The main outcome assessed was percentage of all Zika virus-positive participants who were asymptomatic. We used a quality-effects approach and the double arcsine transformation for the meta-analysis. Findings: We assessed 753 studies for inclusion, of which 23 were included in the meta-analysis, totalling 11 305 Zika virus-positive participants. The high degree of heterogeneity in the studies (I(2) = 99%) suggests that the pooled prevalence of asymptomatic Zika virus-positive participants was probably not a robust estimate. Analysis based on subgroups of the population (general population, returned travellers, blood donors, adults with Guillain-Barre syndrome, pregnant women and babies with microcephaly) was not able to explain the heterogeneity.

In July 2016, mosquito-borne ZIKV transmission was reported in the continental United States; since then, hundreds of locally acquired infections have been reported in Florida. To gain insights into the timing, source, and likely route(s) of ZIKV introduction, we tracked the virus from its first detection in Florida by sequencing ZIKV genomes from infected patients and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We show that at least 4 introductions, but potentially as many as 40, contributed to the outbreak in Florida and that local transmission is likely to have started in the spring of 2016-several months before its initial detection. By analysing surveillance and genetic data, we show that ZIKV moved among transmission zones in Miami.

D.; da Rosa, M. T. M.; da Veiga, A. B. G.","QUESTIONS INVESTIGATED: The recent emergence of arboviruses such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil has posed a threat to human health and to the country's economy. Outbreaks occur mainly in tropical areas; however, increasing number of cases have been observed in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), the Southernmost state; therefore, surveillance of these arboviruses is essential for public health measures. DESIGN: In this study, we analyzed 1276 samples from patients with clinically suspected arboviral diseases between 2014 and 2016. Demographic and clinical data were collected and described; cases of microcephaly associated with congenital infection were analyzed. ESSENTIAL FINDINGS: Results show that CHIKV and ZIKV entered RS in 2014 and 2015, respectively, with imported cases confirmed. Autochthonous infections occurred in 2016 for both viruses, with a total of 5 autochthonous cases for CHIKV and 44 for ZIKV. Most patients were older than 21 years; the main symptoms were fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and headache; rash, conjunctivitis, and pruritus were also reported in ZIKV cases. Three cases of congenital Zika syndrome were confirmed in our study, while another 20 cases of microcephaly associated with congenital infection were confirmed (10 positive for syphilis, 6 for toxoplasmosis and 4 for cytomegalovirus). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Considering co-circulation of different arbovirus in RS, including Dengue virus, CHIKV, and ZIKV, and the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in the area, surveillance of patients infected by these viruses contributes to the control and prevention of such diseases. Practical difficulties in diagnosing these infections are discussed.",2017,Nov,Rev Med Virol,27,6,,28929534,10.1002/rmv.1943,,#2843,Gregianini 2017,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Zika Virus Infection: A Vector-Borne Threat to Pregnant Women and Infants,"Grazel, R.; Harris-Haman, P.","BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent flavivirus, transmitted predominately by Aedes genus mosquitos that recently reached the Americas and was soon implicated in an increase in microcephaly and other serious birth defects. PURPOSE: This report provides updated information and recommendations on testing, screening, and care for pregnant women and infants affected by ZIKV. METHODS: Current published recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and the American Academy of Pediatrics were reviewed and included in this report. RESULTS: Although largely a self-limiting disease usually without symptoms, pregnant women and their fetuses are at greatest risk. Maternal transmission of ZIKV to the fetus can lead to congenital Zika infection with potentially devastating sequelae to the infant. The available evidence suggests that infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, in which the fetus' central nervous system is being formed, is associated with higher risk of brain abnormalities and perinatal loss. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Uncertainties remain about the course of the disease, and the full spectrum of effects of the virus on the developing infant is not yet understood. Infants with congenital Zika syndrome need coordinated follow-up and long-term specialty care, as well as support for the family. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: There is no known cure for ZIKV infection and no vaccine is currently available. The full spectrum of developmental disabilities and other adverse early childhood outcomes associated with congenital ZIKV infection needs to be studied.",2018,Oct,Adv Neonatal Care,18,5,350-359,30239403,10.1097/anc.0000000000000557,,#2846,Grazel 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Zika virus in Gabon (Central Africa)--2007: a new threat from Aedes albopictus?,"Grard, G.; Caron, M.; Mombo, I. M.; Nkoghe, D.; Mboui Ondo, S.; Jiolle, D.; Fontenille, D.; Paupy, C.; Leroy, E. M.","BACKGROUND: Chikungunya and dengue viruses emerged in Gabon in 2007, with large outbreaks primarily affecting the capital Libreville and several northern towns. Both viruses subsequently spread to the south-east of the country, with new outbreaks occurring in 2010. The mosquito species Aedes albopictus, that was known as a secondary vector for both viruses, recently invaded the country and was the primary vector involved in the Gabonese outbreaks. We conducted a retrospective study of human sera and mosquitoes collected in Gabon from 2007 to 2010, in order to identify other circulating arboviruses. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sample collections, including 4312 sera from patients presenting with painful febrile disease, and 4665 mosquitoes belonging to 9 species, split into 247 pools (including 137 pools of Aedes albopictus), were screened with molecular biology methods. Five human sera and two Aedes albopictus pools, all sampled in an urban setting during the 2007 outbreak, were positive for the flavivirus Zika (ZIKV). The ratio of Aedes albopictus pools positive for ZIKV was similar to that positive for dengue virus during the concomitant dengue outbreak suggesting similar mosquito infection rates and, presumably, underlying a human ZIKV outbreak. ZIKV sequences from the envelope and NS3 genes were amplified from a human serum sample. Phylogenetic analysis placed the Gabonese ZIKV at a basal position in the African lineage, pointing to ancestral genetic diversification and spread. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We provide the first direct evidence of human ZIKV infections in Gabon, and its first occurrence in the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. These data reveal an unusual natural life cycle for this virus, occurring in an urban environment, and potentially representing a new emerging threat due to this novel association with a highly invasive vector whose geographic range is still expanding across the globe.",2014,Feb,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,8,2,e2681,24516683,10.1371/journal.pntd.0002681,,#2850,Grard 2014,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,Phylogenetic studies

Zika: the origin and spread of a mosquito-borne virus,"Kindhauser, M. K.; Allen, T.; Frank, V.; Santhana, R. S.; Dye, C.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the temporal and geographical distribution of Zika virus infection and associated neurological disorders, from 1947 to 1 February 2016, when Zika became a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). METHODS: We did a literature search using the terms ""Zika"" and ""ZIKV"" in PubMed, cross-checked the findings for completeness against other published reviews and added formal notifications to WHO submitted under the International Health Regulations. FINDINGS: From the discovery of Zika virus in Uganda in 1947 to the declaration of a PHEIC by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 1 February 2016, a total of 74 countries and territories had reported human Zika virus infections. The timeline in this paper charts the discovery of the virus (1947), its isolation from mosquitos (1948), the first human infection (1952), the initial spread of infection from Asia to a Pacific island (2007), the first known instance of sexual transmission (2008), reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome (2014) and microcephaly (2015) linked to Zika infections and the first appearance of Zika in the Americas (from 2015).

Emerging Infectious Diseases and Blood Safety: Modeling the Transfusion-Transmission Risk,"Kiely, P.; Gambhir, M.; Cheng, A. C.; McQuilten, Z. K.; Seed, C. R.; Wood, E.

Two published models for estimating the transfusion-transmission risk from EIDs, referred to as the Biggerstaff-Petersen model and the European Upfront Risk Assessment Tool (EUFRAT), respectively, have been applied to several EIDs in outbreak situations. We describe and compare the methodological principles of both models, highlighting their similarities and differences. We also discuss the appropriateness of comparing results from the two models. Quantitating the TT risk of EIDs can inform decisions about risk mitigation strategies and their cost-effectiveness. Finally, we present a qualitative risk assessment for Zika virus (ZIKV), an EID agent that has caused several outbreaks since 2007. In the latest and largest ever outbreak, several probable cases of transfusion-transmission ZIKV have been reported, indicating that it is transfusion-transmissible and therefore a risk to blood safety.

Mutational Pressure in Zika Virus: Local ADAR-Editing Areas Associated with Pauses in Translation and Replication,"Khrustalev, V. V.; Khrustaleva, T. A.; Sharma, N.; Giri, R.","Zika virus (ZIKV) spread led to the recent medical health emergency of international concern. Understanding the variations in virus system is of utmost need. Using available complete sequences of ZIKV we estimated directions of mutational pressure along the length of consensus sequences of three lineages of the virus. Results showed that guanine usage is growing in ZIKV RNA plus strand due to adenine to guanine transitions, while adenine usage is growing due to cytosine to adenine transversions. Especially high levels of guanine have been found in two-fold degenerated sites of certain areas of RNA plus strand with high amount of secondary structure. The usage of cytosine in two-fold degenerated sites shows direct dependence on the amount of secondary structure in 52% (consensus sequence of East African ZIKV lineage)-32% (consensus sequence of epidemic strains) of the length of RNA minus strand. These facts are the evidences of ADAR-editing of both strands of ZIKV genome during pauses in replication. RNA plus strand can also be edited by ADAR during pauses in translation caused by the appearance of groups of rare codons. According to our results, RNA minus strand of epidemic ZIKV strain has lower number of points in which polymerase can be stalled (allowing ADAR-editing) compared to other strains.

Infection presents with mild, self-limiting symptoms. Currently, a Zika virus outbreak has spread across most of South and Central America. Travel-related and sexually transmitted cases have been reported across the United States. However, the vector-borne transmission has been limited to Florida and Texas. We present seven cases of Zika virus infection that presented at a single institution in South Florida. METHODS: Patients were included that had real-time polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Zika virus RNA in urine or serum or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody against Zika virus in serum. RESULTS: All seven patients reported recent travel or employment in areas of active Zika virus transmission and at least two of the four most commonly reported symptoms (fever, arthralgia, rash, and conjunctivitis) with a rash present in all patients. All patients had positive RT-PCR for Zika virus RNA in urine. RT-PCR for Zika virus RNA in serum was negative in four of five patients that were tested, indicating that these patients likely presented one to two weeks after symptom onset. CONCLUSION: The future of Zika virus outbreaks in other cities in the United States is still uncertain. However, it is clear that prevention and control policies are urgently needed. We have presented seven confirmed cases of Zika virus infection in South Florida. In addition to conducting research concerning both the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of the virus, there is a need for public awareness of its presentation, methods of transmission, and subsequent clinical outcomes.",2017,Mar-16,Cureus,9,3,e1099,28413745,10.7759/cureus.1099,,#2919,Khawar 2017,"Exclusion reason: case report or case study (i.e. reports on less than 10 cases, but this threshold can be pathogen dependent); ",
Quantifying Zika: Advancing the Epidemiology of Zika With Quantitative Models,"Keegan, L. T.; Lessler, J.; Johansson, M. A.","When Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in the Americas, little was known about its biology, pathogenesis, and transmission potential, and the scope of the epidemic was largely hidden, owing to generally mild infections and no established surveillance systems. Surges in congenital defects and Guillain-Barre syndrome alerted the world to the danger of ZIKV. In the context of limited data, quantitative models were critical in reducing uncertainties and guiding the global ZIKV response. Here, we review some of the models used to assess the risk of ZIKV-associated severe outcomes, the potential speed and size of ZIKV epidemics, and the geographic distribution of ZIKV risk. These models provide important insights and highlight significant unresolved questions related to ZIKV and other emerging pathogens.",2017,Dec-16,J Infect Dis,216,suppl_10,S884-s890,29267915,10.1093/infdis/jix437,,#2939,Keegan 2017,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Useful review

"Estimating Vector-borne Viral Infections in the Urban Setting of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Japan, Using Mathematical Modeling","Furuya, H.","The first domestic outbreak of dengue fever in Japan since 1945 was reported in Tokyo in 2014. Meanwhile, daily mean summer temperatures are expected to continue to rise world-wide. Such conditions are expected to increase the risk of an arbovirus outbreak at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. To address this possibility, the present study compared estimates of the risk of infection by dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses in urban areas. To compare the risk of infection by arboviruses transmitted by Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, the reproduction number for each of three arboviruses was estimated under the environmental conditions associated with the 2014 dengue outbreak in Tokyo, and additionally under conditions assuming a daily mean temperature elevation of 2 degrees C. For dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, the estimated distributions of R0 were independently fitted to gamma distributions yielding median R0 values of 1.00, 0.46, and 0.36, respectively. If the daily mean temperature were to rise from 28 degrees C to 30 degrees C, our model predicts increases of the median R0 of 18% for dengue, 4.3% for chikungunya, and 11.1% for Zika.

"Current challenges and implications for dengue, chikungunya and Zika seroprevalence studies worldwide: A scoping review","Fritzell, C.; Rousset, D.; Adde, A.; Kazanji, M.; Van Kerkhove, M. D.; Flamand, C.","BACKGROUND: Arboviral infections are a public health concern and an escalating problem worldwide. Estimating the burden of these diseases represents a major challenge that is complicated by the large number of unapparent infections, especially those of dengue fever. Serological surveys are thus required to identify the distribution of these diseases and measure their impact. Therefore, we undertook a scoping review of the literature to describe and summarize epidemiological practices, findings and insights related to seroprevalence studies of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus, which have rapidly expanded across the globe in recent years. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Relevant studies were retrieved through a literature search of MEDLINE, WHOLIS, Lilacs, SciELO and Scopus (2000 to 2018). In total, 1389 publications were identified. Studies addressing the seroprevalence of dengue, chikungunya and/or Zika written in English or French and meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. In total, 147 studies were included, from which 185 data points were retrieved, as some studies used several different samples. Most of the studies were exclusively conducted on dengue (66.5%), but 16% were exclusively conducted on chikungunya, and 7 were exclusively conducted on Zika; the remainder were conducted on multiple arboviruses. A wide range of designs were applied, but most studies were conducted in the general population (39%) and in households (41%). Although several assays were used, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were the predominant test used (77%). The temporal distribution of chikungunya studies followed the virus during its rapid expansion since 2004. The results revealed heterogeneity of arboviruses seroprevalence between continents and within a given country for dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses, ranging from 0 to 100%, 76% and 73% respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Serological surveys provide the most direct measurement for defining the immunity landscape for infectious diseases, but the methodology remains difficult to implement. Overall, dengue, chikungunya and Zika serosurveys followed the expansion of these arboviruses, but there remain gaps in their geographic distribution. This review addresses the challenges for researchers regarding study design biases. Moreover, the development of reliable, rapid and affordable diagnosis tools represents a significant issue concerning the ability of seroprevalence surveys to differentiate infections when multiple viruses co-circulate.",2018,Jul,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,12,7,e0006533,30011271,10.1371/journal.pntd.0006533,,#3053,Fritzell 2018,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractorá (2019-11-28 21:22:41)(Select): Lots of seroprevalence studies; ,Review; Useful review

Although it is imported in Spain, there is a risk of autochthonous transmission due to Aedes albopictus presence. Zika disease and congenital cases have been under surveillance since 2016. The objective of this study is to explore the epidemiology of disease and pregnancies result. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out into cases reported to the National Surveillance Network (RENAVE) during the 30/11/2015 to 31/12/2017 period. The case definition and the survey are included in the RENAVE protocol. The variables were: date; notifying region (Autonomous Community (AC)); pregnancy and its evolution; case classification; mode of transmission; country or region of infection; socio-demographical, clinical and microbiological data. A descriptive analysis of the cases and their distribution according to the other variables was carried out. RESULTS: A total of 512 cases were reported by 17 ACs. 507 were non-congenital, of which 327 (64.5%) were women (52.5% of childbearing age). 403 cases (79.5%) corresponded to 2016 and 193 (38.1%) resided in regions with A. albopictus presence between May and October. 96.1% of imported cases were infected in America (51.7% while visiting relatives). Three cases (3.9%) of congenital Zika virus infection were detected among 77 pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of reported cases was in accordance with that of the epidemic in America.

Epidemiology of Zika Virus Infection,"Hills, S. L.; Fischer, M.; Petersen, L. R.","Long known to be endemic in Africa and Southeast Asia and a rare cause of acute febrile illness, Zika virus (ZIKAV) arose from obscurity when an Asian genotype ZIKAV caused an outbreak of mild febrile illness in 2007 in Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia.

After its recognition in the Americas through March 2017, the Pan American Health Organization has received reports of >750000 suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases of autochthonous ZIKAV transmission. Outbreaks in most countries in the Americas peaked in early to mid-2016.

M.; Molina-Velez, D.; Gonzalez-Gonzalez, L.; Hernandez-Avila, M.","Objective: To assess the magnitude of the Mexican epidemic of Zika virus infection and the associated risk of microcephaly. Methods: From the reported number of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic infections among pregnant women and the relevant birth rate, we estimated the number of symptomatic cases of infection that occurred in Mexico between 25 November 2015, when the first confirmed Mexican case was reported, and 20 August 2016. We used data from the birth certificates to compare mean monthly incidences of congenital microcephaly before (1 January 2010-30 November 2015) and after (1 December 2015-30 September 2017) the introduction of Zika virus, stratifying the data according to whether the mother's place of residence was at an altitude of at least 2200 m above sea level.

Findings: Our estimated number of symptomatic cases of infection that may have occurred in the general population of Mexico between 25 November 2015 and 20 August 2016, 60 172, was 7.3-fold higher than the corresponding number of reported cases.

Potential inconsistencies in Zika surveillance data and our understanding of risk during pregnancy,"Hay, J. A.; Nouvellet, P.; Donnelly, C. A.; Riley, S.","BACKGROUND: A significant increase in microcephaly incidence was reported in Northeast Brazil at the end of 2015, which has since been attributed to an epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infections earlier that year. Further incidence of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) was expected following waves of ZIKV infection throughout Latin America; however, only modest increases in microcephaly and CZS incidence have since been observed. The quantitative relationship between ZIKV infection, gestational age and congenital outcome remains poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We characterised the gestational-age-varying risk of microcephaly given ZIKV infection using publicly available incidence data from multiple locations in Brazil and Colombia. We found that the relative timings and shapes of ZIKV infection and microcephaly incidence curves suggested different gestational risk profiles for different locations, varying in both the duration and magnitude of gestational risk. Data from Northeast Brazil suggested a narrow window of risk during the first trimester, whereas data from Colombia suggested persistent risk throughout pregnancy. We then used the model to estimate which combination of behavioural and reporting changes would have been sufficient to explain the absence of a second microcephaly incidence wave in Bahia, Brazil; a population for which we had two years of data. We found that a 18.9-fold increase in ZIKV infection reporting rate was consistent with observed patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our study illustrates how surveillance data may be used in principle to answer key questions in the absence of directed epidemiological studies. However, in this case, we suggest that currently available surveillance data are insufficient to accurately estimate the gestational-age-varying risk of microcephaly from ZIKV infection. The methods used here may be of use in future outbreaks and may help to inform improved surveillance and interpretation in countries yet to experience an outbreak of ZIKV infection.",2018,Dec,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,12,12,e0006991,30532143,10.1371/journal.pntd.0006991,,#3225,Hay 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Donation-based surveillance provides an alternative strategy to estimate population prevalence by detecting antibodies that are circulating. To estimate population prevalence, we conducted a systematic review of literature on the seroprevalence of ZIKV and DENV antibodies in blood donations. We searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies that reported the seroprevalence of ZIKV and DENV in blood donations. The title and abstract of each study were screened by 2 reviewers simultaneously for possible inclusion, and the full text of selected studies was reviewed to ensure that they met inclusion criteria (used primary data collection, reported evidence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the blood supply, and included a representative sample of the total population). Immunoglobin test measuring levels of antibodies to IgM and IgG and number of positive cases were extracted from each study. No exclusions were made based on language or country. Our initial search identified 1890 studies after excluding duplicates, of which 76 were assessed for full text eligibility to ensure that they met our final inclusion criteria. There were 14 studies included in our review; 11 examined the seroprevalence of DENV, and 3 examined ZIKV. The highest seroprevalence by IgM was 2.82% for DENV and 0.53% for ZIKV. Our results indicate that the seroprevalence of ZIKV and DENV antibody presence in countries with active transmission is higher than reports by traditional surveillance in some countries. This finding is expected due to the large percentage of asymptomatic cases. The highest seroprevalence was observed for IgG, which can persist over long periods of time compared to IgM.

Infection has also been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome (3). In December 2015, Puerto Rico became the first U.S. jurisdiction to report local transmission of Zika virus, with the index patient reporting symptom onset on November 23, 2015 (4). This report provides an update to the epidemiology of and public health response to ongoing Zika virus transmission in Puerto Rico. During November 1, 2015-April 14, 2016, a total of 6,157 specimens from suspected Zika virus-infected patients were evaluated by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) and CDC Dengue Branch (which is located in San Juan, Puerto Rico), and 683 (11%) had laboratory evidence of current or recent Zika virus infection by one or more tests: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Zika virus-infected patients resided in 50 (64%) of 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico. Median age was 34 years (range = 35 days-89 years). The most frequently reported signs and symptoms were rash (74%), myalgia (68%), headache (63%), fever (63%), and arthralgia (63%). There were 65 (10%) symptomatic pregnant women who tested positive by RT-PCR or IgM ELISA. A total of 17 (2%) patients required hospitalization, including 5 (1%) patients with suspected Guillain-Barre syndrome. One (<1%) patient died after developing severe thrombocytopenia. The public health response to the outbreak has included increased laboratory capacity to test for Zika virus infection (including blood donor screening), implementation of enhanced surveillance systems, and prevention activities focused on pregnant women. Vector control activities include indoor and outdoor residual spraying and reduction of mosquito breeding environments focused around pregnant women's homes. Residents of and travelers to Puerto Rico should continue to employ mosquito bite avoidance behaviors, take precautions to reduce the risk for sexual transmission (5), and seek medical care for any acute illness with rash or fever.",2016,May-06,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,65,17,451-5,27149205,10.15585/mmwr.mm6517e2,,#3388,Dirlikov 2016,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study type (comment, letter, etc); Extractor (2024-09-20 20:00:27)(Select): outbreak...

Understanding social inequalities in Zika infection and its consequences: A model of pathways and policy entry-points,"Diderichsen, F.; Augusto, Lgds; Perez, B.","The health consequences of arbovirus infections such as dengue fever (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) has in recent years become a public health challenge, due to failure of prevention followed by increased incidence and pronounced social inequality in occurrence and consequences. This motivates a more systematic analysis of the potential mechanisms and pathways that generate these inequalities. We present in the paper a model that delineates five possible mechanisms driving the inequality of ZIKV and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). They include differential exposure to bad housing and sanitary conditions, differential exposure to vector density and virus, differential vulnerability to the health effects of exposure to virus, differential intrauterine susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of ZIKV infection and differential social consequences of caring for a disabled child. For each mechanism, we present empirical evidence or need for more research as well as a discussion about policy implications.",2018,Oct-09,Glob Public Health,,,01-Sep,30301438,10.1080/17441692.2018.1532528,,#3412,Diderichsen 2018,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,

The samples were originally collected between the 30 and 46 epidemiological weeks (EW) when the ZIKV was not yet declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). From the total 4016 negative samples, a total of one hundred samples, 50 from Veracruz (CHIK(-) DENV(-)) and 50 from Yucatan (4 CHIK(-) DENV(-) and 46 CHIK(-) or DENV(-)), were tested for Zika virus by using RT-PCR. Results showed that in Veracruz and Yucatan, 20 % (10/50) and 70 % (35/50) were, respectively, ZIKV positive, indicating unequivocally the presence of ZIKV at least since July 2015.

R.","INTRODUCTION: A considerable increase of imported Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been reported in Europe in the last year. This is the result of the large outbreak of the disease in the Americas, along with the increase in the numbers of travellers and immigrants arriving from ZIKV endemic areas. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted in the Tropical Medicine Unit of Hospital La Paz-Carlos III in Madrid on travellers returning from an endemic area for ZIKV from January to April 2016. Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were screened for ZIKV (59.9% women, median age of 37.7+/-10.3 years). Main purpose of the travel was tourism to Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico. Just under three-quarters (73%) were symptomatic, mostly with fever and headache. A total of 13 patients (7% of those screened) were diagnosed with ZIKV infections, of which four of them were pregnant. All of them were symptomatic patients, the majority immigrants, and mainly from Colombia. Diagnostic tests were based on positive neutralization antibodies (8 cases, 61.6%) and a positive RT-PCR in different organic fluids (7 cases, 53.8%) The four infected pregnant women underwent a neurosonography every 3 weeks, and no alterations were detected. RT-PCR in amniotic fluid was performed in three of them, with negative results. One of the children has already been born healthy.

Epidemiology of Zika,"Deseda, C. C.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Zika virus (ZIKV) is the latest 'emerging virus' that has affected the Americas. First identified in the mid-20th century in Uganda, it was described as a vector arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) and subsequently found capable of producing illness in humans. The illness was not different from other flavivirus infections and caused a relatively mild disease characterized by low-grade fever, nonspecific exanthem, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, and mild to moderate arthralgia. It was capable of producing infections described as sporadic isolated cases; in 2007, it was confirmed as the pathogen causing the first known ZIKV epidemic subsequently associated with congenital neonatal microcephaly in many countries in the Americas. RECENT FINDINGS: It rapidly spread to other countries in the Americas and, as of September 2016, it has been detected in 46 countries and territories. Different from other flavivirus infections, ZIKV has proven to be related to more serious complications. These include Guillain-Barre syndrome and neonatal congenital malformations, which includes microcephaly and neurologic damage to the developing fetus, particularly if the maternal infection occurs early in pregnancy. These two complications are a cause of great concern. SUMMARY: It is pivotal to conduct epidemiological laboratory-based surveillance and studies on the virus' inherent characteristics to understand the pathophysiology of this infection and develop adequate strategies to mitigate this new threat.",2017,Feb,Curr Opin Pediatr,29,1,97-101,27845968,10.1097/mop.0000000000000442,,#3447,Deseda 2017,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-09-12 00:29:30)(Select): review; ,
Mitigation of the threat posed to transfusion by donors traveling to Zika-affected areas: a Canadian risk-based approach,"Germain, M.; Delage, G.; O'Brien, S. F.; Gregoire, Y.; Fearon, M.; Devine, D.","BACKGROUND: The recent spread of the Zika virus to the Americas and the recognition that it can cause severe disease in the developing fetus has prompted the adoption of measures to mitigate the risk that this virus might pose to transfusion safety. In nonendemic countries, the risk to transfusion results from donors traveling to an endemic region. Canada implemented a 21-day temporary deferral for prospective donors who traveled to such regions. We present the rationale for this policy, including a quantitative risk assessment supported by a Monte Carlo simulation. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The model considered the following parameters, each with specified values and ranges: the probability that a donor recently returned from a Zika-endemic region, the duration of travel to this region, the daily risk of acquiring Zika while in an endemic region, and the incubation and viremic periods. We ran the simulation 20 times, each with 10 million iterations. RESULTS: In the absence of any travel deferral, 32 donors (range, 20-46 donors) would be able to donate while still being at risk of transmitting Zika, corresponding to a rate of 1:312,500 (range, 1:217,000 to 1:500,000). None of these donors would be viremic beyond 21 days after returning from their travel, with a risk estimated at less than 1:200,000,000. CONCLUSIONS: A 21-day temporary travel deferral offers an extremely wide margin of safety for the possible transmission of Zika by a donation obtained from someone who recently returned from a country where the virus is circulating.",2017,Oct,Transfusion,57,10,2463-2468,28758222,10.1111/trf.14247,,#3454,Germain 2017,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Association of Zika Virus Exposure in Utero with Ocular Phenotypes in a Group of Newborns in Puerto Rico Exposure with ocular phenotypes in newborns in Puerto Rico,"Gely-Rojas, L.; Perez, R.; Garcia-Fragoso, L.; Garcia-Garcia, I.","OBJECTIVE: After the outbreak in January 2016, researchers in Brazil reported the first cases of ophthalmic abnormalities in infants with microcephaly and presumed Zika virus (ZIKV) intrauterine infection. Screening for ocular lesions in all newborns exposed to ZIKV prenatally has been emphasized because of a chorioretinal macular scar found in a number normocephalic patient exposed to ZIKV. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of infants born to mothers found to be ZIKV-positive during their pregnancies (January 2016-July 2017) was performed. We included all newborns and infants admitted to the NICU and/or receiving ambulatory care at the high-risk clinics at the University Pediatric Hospital, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The creation of this database was approved by the IRB of the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus. RESULTS: Records from 234 newborns born to Zika-positive mothers were identified. The ophthalmic evaluations of 95 patients were available. Sixty-three of them had normal findings (66%). Twelve of the 95 patients had microcephaly (12.6% of the cohort). Of the microcephalic group, half had normal ophthalmological findings. Of the normocephalic group (83/95), almost 31% had ocular findings: a small optic nerve in 3%, a double-ring sign in 10%, macular stippling in 8%, mottling in 4%, an oval optic nerve in 2%, a tilted nerve in 1%, and blunted foveal reflex in 1%. CONCLUSION: We report herein ZIKV associated ophthalmologic findings, similar to those published, in 34% of the infants with suspected/confirmed ZIKV fetal exposure.

D.","OBJECTIVE: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was identified in Puerto Rico on December 2015, and the outbreak encouraged us to characterize clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of intrauterine exposed infants. METHODS: Retrospective medical record review of infants born to mothers with confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy was performed from January 2016-June 2017. We included patients admitted to UPH Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or referred for follow-up at UPH High Risk Clinics. The database was approved by the University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, IRB. RESULTS: 191 infants born to ZIKV positive mothers during pregnancy were identified. Normal head sonogram was found in 93% of the normo cephalic infants. Ocular findings were reported in 50% of the patients with microcephaly and 31% of the normo-cephalics. Fifteen newborns (7.8%) presented with microcephaly, of which 73% showed calcifications in head sonogram, and had severe anomalies on brain MRI. Auditory brainstem response test was performed on all newborns, 80% were within normal limits. CONCLUSION: Among the group of infants born to mothers with Zika positive test 4% had microcephaly. Of concern to us is the fact that 31% of normo cephalic infants had ocular manifestations and 7% of them had findings on head sonogram.

METHODS: Cases of febrile exanthematous disease and acute flaccid paralysis were reviewed during the period from 1 August to 15 December, 2016; clinical and biochemical assessment was performed for each case to identify Zika-related Guillain-Barre syndrome. RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 8 patients (6 men and 2 women) with Zika-related Guillain-Barre syndrome, with the most affected age group being 50-59 years. The highest incidence was in the month of September, with 7 cases. The most frequent symptoms were rash and conjunctivitis, followed by fever. The most common presentation was symmetrical ascending paralysis, present in 7 cases. Cranial nerve VII was the most frequently involved nerve. Only 2 patients presented albuminocytologic dissociation. RT-PCR returned negative results for Zika virus in all patients. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and all had a good prognosis. None warranted mechanical ventilation. No deaths were recorded. The cumulative incidence rate was 3.9%, monthly incidence was between 0.04 and 2 cases/month.

To better understand the impact of birth defects resulting from Zika virus infection, the CDC surveillance case definition established in 2016 for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection* (2) was retrospectively applied to population-based birth defects surveillance data collected during 2013-2014 in three areas before the introduction of Zika virus (the pre-Zika years) into the World Health Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) (3).

Sexual transmission of Zika virus and other flaviviruses: A living systematic review,"Counotte, M. J.; Kim, C. R.; Wang, J.; Bernstein, K.; Deal, C. D.; Broutet, N. J. N.; Low, N.","BACKGROUND: Health authorities in the United States and Europe reported an increasing number of travel-associated episodes of sexual transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) following the 2015-2017 ZIKV outbreak. This, and other scientific evidence, suggests that ZIKV is sexually transmissible in addition to having its primary mosquito-borne route. The objective of this systematic review and evidence synthesis was to clarify the epidemiology of sexually transmitted ZIKV. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a living (i.e., continually updated) systematic review of evidence published up to 15 April 2018 about sexual transmission of ZIKV and other arthropod-borne flaviviruses in humans and other animals. We defined 7 key elements of ZIKV sexual transmission for which we extracted data: (1) rectal and vaginal susceptibility to infection, (2) incubation period following sexual transmission, (3) serial interval between the onset of symptoms in a primary and secondary infected individuals, (4) duration of infectiousness, (5) reproduction number, (6) probability of transmission per sex act, and (7) transmission rate. We identified 1,227 unique publications and included 128, of which 77 presented data on humans and 51 presented data on animals. Laboratory experiments confirm that rectal and vaginal mucosae are susceptible to infection with ZIKV and that the testis serves as a reservoir for the virus in animal models. Sexual transmission was reported in 36 human couples: 34/36 of these involved male-to-female sexual transmission. The median serial symptom onset interval in 15 couples was 12 days (interquartile range: 10-14.5); the maximum was 44 days. We found evidence from 2 prospective cohorts that ZIKV RNA is present in human semen with a median duration of 34 days (95% CI: 28-41 days) and 35 days (no CI given) (low certainty of evidence, according to GRADE). Aggregated data about detection of ZIKV RNA from 37 case reports and case series indicate a median duration of detection of ZIKV of 40 days (95% CI: 30-49 days) and maximum duration of 370 days in semen. In human vaginal fluid, median duration was 14 days (95% CI: 7-20 days) and maximum duration was 37 days (very low certainty). Infectious virus in human semen was detected for a median duration of 12 days (95% CI: 1-21 days) and maximum of 69 days. Modelling studies indicate that the reproduction number is below 1 (very low certainty). Evidence was lacking to estimate the incubation period or the transmission rate. Evidence on sexual transmission of other flaviviruses was scarce. The certainty of the evidence is limited because of uncontrolled residual bias. CONCLUSIONS: The living systematic review and sexual transmission framework allowed us to assess evidence about the risk of sexual transmission of ZIKV. ZIKV is more likely transmitted from men to women than from women to men. For other flaviviruses, evidence of sexual transmissibility is still absent. Taking into account all available data about the duration of detection of ZIKV in culture and from the serial interval, our findings suggest that the infectious period for sexual transmission of ZIKV is shorter than estimates from the earliest post-outbreak studies, which were based on reverse transcription PCR alone.",2018,Jul,PLoS Med,15,7,e1002611,30040845,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002611,,#3556,Counotte 2018,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Zika virus infection as a cause of congenital brain abnormalities and Guillain-Barre syndrome: From systematic review to living systematic review,"Counotte, M. J.; Egli-Gany, D.; Riesen, M.; Abraha, M.; Porgo, T. V.; Wang, J.; Low, N.","Background. The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Americas has caused international concern due to neurological sequelae linked to the infection, such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The World Health Organization stated that there is ""sufficient evidence to conclude that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of GBS"". This conclusion was based on a systematic review of the evidence published until 30.05.2016. Since then, the body of evidence has grown substantially, leading to this update of that systematic review with new evidence published from 30.05.2016 - 18.01.2017, update 1. Methods. We review evidence on the causal link between ZIKV infection and adverse congenital outcomes and the causal link between ZIKV infection and GBS or immune-mediated thrombocytopaenia purpura. We also describe the transition of the review into a living systematic review, a review that is continually updated. Results. Between 30.05.2016 and 18.01.2017, we identified 2413 publications, of which 101 publications were included. The evidence added in this update confirms the conclusion of a causal association between ZIKV and adverse congenital outcomes. New findings expand the evidence base in the dimensions of biological plausibility, strength of association, animal experiments and specificity. For GBS, the body of evidence has grown during the search period for update 1, but only for dimensions that were already populated in the previous version. There is still a limited understanding of the biological pathways that potentially cause the occurrence of autoimmune disease following ZIKV infection. Conclusions. This systematic review confirms previous conclusions that ZIKV is a cause of congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly, and is a trigger of GBS. The transition to living systematic review techniques and methodology provides a proof of concept for the use of these methods to synthesise evidence about an emerging pathogen such as ZIKV.",2018,,F1000Res,7,,196,30631437,10.12688/f1000research.13704.1,,#3557,Counotte 2018,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-09-12 00:30:55)(Select): review; ,

V.; Santos, A. M. D.; Silva, Aamd","Dengue fever, chikungunya fever, and zika virus infections are increasing public health problems in the world, the last two diseases having recently emerged in Brazil. This ecological study employed spatial analysis of probable cases of dengue fever, chikungunya fever, and zika virus infections reported to the National Mandatory Reporting System (SINAN) in Maranhao State from 2015 to 2016. The software GeoDa version 1.10 was used for calculating global and local Moran indices. The global Moran index identified a significant autocorrelation of incidence rates of dengue (I=0.10; p=0.009) and zika (I=0.07; p=0.03). The study found a positive spatial correlation between dengue and the population density (I=0.31; p<0.001) and a negative correlation with the Performance Index of Unified Health System (PIUHS) by basic care coverage (I=-0.08; p=0.01). Regarding chikungunya fever, there were positive spatial correlations with the population density (I=0.06; p=0.03) and the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) (I=0.10; p=0.002), and a negative correlation with the Gini index (I=-0.01; p<0.001) and the PIUHS by basic care coverage (I=-0.18; p<0.001). Lastly, we found positive spatial correlations between Zika virus infections and the population density (I=0.13; p=0.005) and the MHDI (I=0.12; p<0.001), as well as a negative correlation with the Gini index (I=-0.11; p<0.001) and the PIUHS by basic care coverage (I=-0.05; p=0.03).

Results of a Zika Virus (ZIKV) Immunoglobulin M-Specific Diagnostic Assay Are Highly Correlated With Detection of Neutralizing Anti-ZIKV Antibodies in Neonates With Congenital Disease,"Cordeiro, M.

T.","BACKGROUND: Usually, immunoglobulin M (IgM) serologic analysis is not sufficiently specific to confirm Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. However, since IgM does not cross the placenta, it may be a good marker of infection in neonates. METHODS: We tested blood from 42 mothers and neonates with microcephaly and collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 30 neonates. Molecular assays were performed for detection of ZIKV, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus; IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) were performed to detect ZIKV and dengue virus. No control neonates without microcephaly were evaluated. RESULTS: Among neonates, all 42 tested positive for ZIKV IgM: 38 of 42 serum specimens (90.5%) were positive, whereas 30 of 30 CSF specimens (100%) were positive. ZIKV IgM-specific ELISA ratios, calculated as the mean optical density (OD) of the test sample when reacted on viral antigen divided by the mean OD of the negative control when reacted with viral antigen, were higher in CSF specimens (median, 14.9 [range, 9.3-16.4]) than in serum (median, 8.9 [range, 2.1-20.6]; P = .0003). All ZIKV IgM-positive results among the neonates were confirmed by the detection of neutralizing antibodies. Mother/neonate pairs with primary ZIKV infection had neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV only, and mother/neonate pairs with ZIKV virus infection secondary to infection with another flavivirus had high titers of neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV. Among secondary infections, median titers in serum were 2072 (range, 232-12 980) for mothers and 2730 (range, 398-12 980) for neonates (P < .0001), and the median titer in CSF was 93 (range, 40-578) among neonates (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Among neonates, detection of ZIKV IgM in serum is confirmatory of congenital ZIKV infection, and detection of ZIKV IgM in CSF is confirmatory of neurologic infection. Therefore, we recommend testing for ZIKV IgM in neonates suspected of having congenital ZIKV infection and performance of PRNTs in equivocal cases.",2016,Dec-15,J Infect Dis,214,12,1897-1904,27923950,10.1093/infdis/jiw477,,#3575,Cordeiro 2016,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
After the epidemic: Zika virus projections for Latin America and the Caribbean,"Colon-Gonzalez, F. J.; Peres, C. A.; Steiner Sao Bernardo, C.; Hunter, P. R.; Lake, I. R.","BACKGROUND: Zika is one of the most challenging emergent vector-borne diseases, yet its future public health impact remains unclear. Zika was of little public health concern until recent reports of its association with congenital syndromes. By 3 August 2017 approximately 217,000 Zika cases and approximately 3,400 cases of associated congenital syndrome were reported in Latin America and the Caribbean. Some modelling exercises suggest that Zika virus infection could become endemic in agreement with recent declarations from the The World Health Organisation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We produced high-resolution spatially-explicit projections of Zika cases, associated congenital syndromes and monetary costs for Latin America and the Caribbean now that the epidemic phase of the disease appears to be over. In contrast to previous studies which have adopted a modelling approach to map Zika potential, we project case numbers using a statistical approach based upon reported dengue case data as a Zika surrogate. Our results indicate that approximately 12.3 (0.7-162.3) million Zika cases could be expected across Latin America and the Caribbean every year, leading to approximately 64.4 (0.2-5159.3) thousand cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome and approximately 4.7 (0.0-116.3) thousand cases of microcephaly. The economic burden of these neurological sequelae are estimated to be USD approximately 2.3 (USD 0-159.3) billion per annum. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Zika is likely to have significant public health consequences across Latin America and the Caribbean in years to come.

Higher incidence of Zika in adult women than adult men in Rio de Janeiro suggests a significant contribution of sexual transmission from men to women,"Coelho, F. C.; Durovni, B.; Saraceni, V.; Lemos, C.; Codeco, C. T.; Camargo, S.; de Carvalho, L. M.; Bastos, L.; Arduini, D.; Villela, D. A.; Armstrong, M.","OBJECTIVES: The recent emergence of Zika in Brazil and its association with an increased rate of congenital malformations has raised concerns over its impact on the birth rate in the country. Using data on the incidence of Zika in 2015-2016 and dengue in 2013 and 2015-2016 for the city of Rio de Janeiro (population 6.4 million), a massive increase of Zika in women compared to men was documented. METHODS: The age-adjusted incidence was compared between men and women. A negative binomial Poisson generalized linear model was fitted to the Zika incidence data to determine the significance of sexual transmission statistically. RESULTS: Even after correcting for the bias due to the systematic testing of pregnant women for Zika, there were found to be 90% more registered cases per 100000 women than men in the sexually active age group (15-65 years); this was not the case for age groups <15 years and >65 years. Assuming that infected men transmit the disease to women in their semen, but that the converse is not true, some extra incidence in women is to be expected. An alternate hypothesis would be that women visit doctors more often than men. To test this, the incidence of dengue fever was compared in men and women in 2015 and in 2013 (before Zika reached Rio de Janeiro): in both years, women were 30% more likely to be reported with dengue. CONCLUSION: Women in the sexually active age group are far more likely to get Zika than men (+90% increase); sexual transmission is the most probable cause. Women in the 15-65 years age group are also 30% more likely to be reported with dengue than men, which is probably due to women being more careful with their health.",2016,Oct,Int J Infect Dis,51,,128-132,27664930,10.1016/j.ijid.2016.08.023,,#3619,Coelho 2016,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Microcephaly Prevalence in Infants Born to Zika Virus-Infected Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Coelho, A. V. C.; Crovella, S.","Zika virus is an emergent flavivirus transmitted by Aedes genus mosquitoes that recently reached the Americas and was soon implicated in an increase of microcephaly incidence. The objective of the present study is to systematically review the published data and perform a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of microcephaly in babies born to Zika virus-infected women during pregnancy. We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases, included cohort studies, and excluded case reports and case series publications. We extracted sample sizes and the number of microcephaly cases from eight studies, which permitted a calculation of prevalence rates that are pooled in a random-effects model meta-analysis. We estimated the prevalence of microcephaly of 2.3% (95% CI = 1.0-5.3%) among all pregnancies. Limitations include mixed samples of women infected at different pregnancy times, since it is known that infection at the first trimester is associated with higher risk to congenital anomalies. The estimates are deceptively low, given the devastating impact the infection causes over children and their families.

Differential Susceptibilities of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus from the Americas to Zika Virus,"Chouin-Carneiro, T.; Vega-Rua, A.; Vazeille, M.; Yebakima, A.; Girod, R.; Goindin, D.; Dupont-Rouzeyrol, M.; Lourenco-de-Oliveira, R.; Failloux, A. B.","BACKGROUND: Since the major outbreak in 2007 in the Yap Island, Zika virus (ZIKV) causing dengue-like syndromes has affected multiple islands of the South Pacific region. In May 2015, the virus was detected in Brazil and then spread through South and Central America. In December 2015, ZIKV was detected in French Guiana and Martinique. The aim of the study was to evaluate the vector competence of the mosquito spp. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus from the Caribbean (Martinique, Guadeloupe), North America (southern United States), South America (Brazil, French Guiana) for the currently circulating Asian genotype of ZIKV isolated from a patient in April 2014 in New Caledonia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mosquitoes were orally exposed to an Asian genotype of ZIKV (NC-2014-5132). Upon exposure, engorged mosquitoes were maintained at 28 degrees +/- 1 degrees C, a 16h:8h light:dark cycle and 80% humidity. 25-30 mosquitoes were processed at 4, 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi). Mosquito bodies (thorax and abdomen), heads and saliva were analyzed to measure infection, dissemination and transmission, respectively. High infection but lower disseminated infection and transmission rates were observed for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Ae. aegypti populations from Guadeloupe and French Guiana exhibited a higher dissemination of ZIKV than the other Ae. aegypti populations examined. Transmission of ZIKV was observed in both mosquito species at 14 dpi but at a low level. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that although susceptible to infection, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were unexpectedly low competent vectors for ZIKV. This may suggest that other factors such as the large naive population for ZIKV and the high densities of human-biting mosquitoes contribute to the rapid spread of ZIKV during the current outbreak.",2016,Mar,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,10,3,e0004543,26938868,10.1371/journal.pntd.0004543,,#3654,Chouin-Carneiro 2016,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Surveillance on the endemic of Zika virus infection by meteorological factors in Colombia: a population-based spatial and temporal study,"Chien, L. C.; Lin, R. T.; Liao, Y.; Sy, F. S.; Perez, A.","BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a pandemic and a public health emergency. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily the Aedes genus. In light of no treatment currently, it is crucial to develop effective vector control programs to prevent the spread of ZIKV infection earlier when observing possible risk factors, such as weather conditions enhancing mosquito breeding and surviving. METHODS: This study collected daily meteorological measurements and weekly ZIKV infectious cases among 32 departments of Colombia from January 2015-December 2016. This study applied the distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate the association between the number of ZIKA virus infection and meteorological measurements, controlling for spatial and temporal variations. We examined at most three meteorological factors with 20 lags in weeks in the model. RESULTS: Average humidity, total rainfall, and maximum temperature were more predictable of ZIKV infection outbreaks than other meteorological factors. Our models can detect significantly lagged effects of average humidity, total rainfall, and maximum temperature on outbreaks up to 15, 14, and 20 weeks, respectively. The spatial analysis identified 12 departments with a significant threat of ZIKV, and eight of those high-risk departments were located between the Equator and 6 degrees N. The outbreak prediction also performed well in identified high-risk departments. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that meteorological factors could be used for predicting ZIKV epidemics.

A.; Johansson, M. A.","Importance: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital microcephaly and severe fetal brain defects, and it has been associated with other adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Objective: To estimate the number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV in Puerto Rico and the number of associated congenital microcephaly cases. Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a modeling study from April to July 2016. Using parameters derived from published reports, outcomes were modeled probabilistically using Monte Carlo simulation. We used uncertainty distributions to reflect the limited information available for parameter values. Given the high level of uncertainty in model parameters, interquartile ranges (IQRs) are presented as primary results. Outcomes were modeled for pregnant women in Puerto Rico, which currently has more confirmed ZIKV cases than any other US location. Exposure: Zika virus infection in pregnant women. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of pregnant women infected with ZIKV and number of congenital microcephaly cases. Results: We estimated an IQR of 5900 to 10300 pregnant women (median, 7800) might be infected during the initial ZIKV outbreak in Puerto Rico. Of these, an IQR of 100 to 270 infants (median, 180) may be born with microcephaly due to congenital ZIKV infection from mid-2016 to mid-2017. In the absence of a ZIKV outbreak, an IQR of 9 to 16 cases (median, 12) of congenital microcephaly are expected in Puerto Rico per year. Conclusions and Relevance: The estimate of 5900 to 10300 pregnant women that might be infected with ZIKV provides an estimate for the number of infants that could potentially have ZIKV-associated adverse outcomes. Including baseline cases of microcephaly, we estimated that an IQR of 110 to 290 total cases of congenital microcephaly, mostly attributable to ZIKV infection, could occur from mid-2016 to mid-2017 in the absence of effective interventions. The primary limitation in this analysis is uncertainty in model parameters. Multivariate sensitivity analyses indicated that the cumulative incidence of ZIKV infection and risk of microcephaly given maternal infection in the first trimester were the primary drivers of both magnitude and uncertainty in the estimated number of microcephaly cases. Increased information on these parameters would lead to more precise estimates. Nonetheless, the results underscore the need for urgent actions being undertaken in Puerto Rico to prevent congenital ZIKV infection and prepare for affected infants.",2016,Oct-01,JAMA Pediatr,170,10,940-945,27544075,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2974,,#3696,Ellington 2016,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,
"Congenital Zika Syndrome: Prevalence of low birth weight and associated factors. Bahia, 2015-2017","Carvalho-Sauer, R.; Costa, Mdcn; Barreto, F. R.; Teixeira, M. G.","OBJECTIVE: The clinical manifestations of Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) are not fully known, as example its effect on birth weight. This study estimated the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) among children with CZS, and identified associated factors. METHODS: Cross-sectional study involving 393 children with CZS living in Bahia, Brazil, in 2015-2017. Official Information Systems were the data sources. We calculated LBW prevalence and applied Logistic Regression to assess associated factors. RESULTS: Prevalence of LBW among children with CZS was 37.2%. Excluding pre-term births the proportion was 29.9%. This prevalence was 81.0% and 28.0%, among children born pre-term and term/post term, respectively. There was a higher proportion (53.2%) in female children, and ones delivered by cesarean section (51.4%). Most mothers were single/separated (62.1%) and had a low level of schooling (70.0%). In the model adjusted for type of delivery, preterm births presented a 10.8 times greater chance of presenting LBW than term/post-term ones. However, the Confidence Interval was very wide. Adjusting for gestation duration, children born by cesarean section had a 1.63 higher probability of presenting LBW than those born by vaginal delivery (OR=1,63; CI95% 1.01, 2.63). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LBW among children with CZS was very elevated, both preterm and term/post-term live births. This can contribute to increasing their risk for morbimortality.

Recently, it has emerged as a new public health threat that caused a large outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013-2014 and since 2015 an explosive outbreak in Brazil, with an increase in severe congenital malformations (microcephaly) and neurological complications, mainly Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Since then, it has spread through the Americas. On 1 February 2016, the WHO declared the ZIKV epidemic in Brazil a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. We reviewed the epidemiology of ZIKV infection, clinical presentations and diagnosis. We highlighted the clinical features and nonvector borne transmission of the virus. RECENT FINDINGS: Association between ZIKV infection and severe foetal outcomes, including microcephaly and other birth defects; increased rate of GBS and other neurological complications due to the ongoing ZIKV outbreak; increased evidence to date of ZIKV being the only arbovirus linked to sexual transmission; the challenge of ZIKV diagnosis; and the need for a specific point-of care test in epidemic scenarios.

We defined confirmed infection-related microcephaly in liveborn infants as the presence of a head circumference of at least 2 SDs below the mean for their age and sex, accompanied by diagnostic imaging consistent with an infectious cause, or laboratory, clinical, or epidemiological results positive for Zika virus or STORCH (infectious agents known to cause congenital infection, mainly syphilis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus). We excluded cases of congenital anomalies or death without microcephaly. We analyse the spatial clustering of these diseases in Brazil to obtain the kernel density estimation. FINDINGS: Two distinct waves of possible Zika virus infection extended across all Brazilian regions in 2015 and 2016. 1 673 272 notified cases were reported, of which 41 473 (2.5%) were in pregnant women. During this period, 1950 cases of infection-related microcephaly were confirmed. Most cases (1373 [70.4%]) occurred in the northeast region after the first wave of Zika virus infection, with peak monthly occurrence estimated at 49.9 cases per 10 000 livebirths. After a major, well documented second wave of Zika virus infection in all regions of Brazil from September, 2015, to September, 2016, occurrence of microcephaly was much lower than that following the first wave of Zika virus infection, reaching epidemic levels in all but the south of Brazil, with estimated monthly peaks varying from 3.2 cases to 15 cases per 10 000 livebirths. INTERPRETATION: The distribution of infection-related microcephaly after Zika virus outbreaks has varied across time and Brazilian regions. Reasons for these apparent differences remain to be elucidated.

T.","BACKGROUND: The microcephaly epidemic, which started in Brazil in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO in 2016. We report the preliminary results of a case-control study investigating the association between microcephaly and Zika virus infection during pregnancy. METHODS: We did this case-control study in eight public hospitals in Recife, Brazil. Cases were neonates with microcephaly. Two controls (neonates without microcephaly), matched by expected date of delivery and area of residence, were selected for each case. Serum samples of cases and controls and cerebrospinal fluid samples of cases were tested for Zika virus-specific IgM and by quantitative RT-PCR. Laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy was defined as detection of Zika virus-specific IgM or a positive RT-PCR result in neonates. Maternal serum samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralisation assay for Zika virus and dengue virus. We estimated crude odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs using a median unbiased estimator for binary data in an unconditional logistic regression model. We estimated ORs separately for cases with and without radiological evidence of brain abnormalities. FINDINGS: Between Jan 15, 2016, and May 2, 2016, we prospectively recruited 32 cases and 62 controls. 24 (80%) of 30 mothers of cases had Zika virus infection compared with 39 (64%) of 61 mothers of controls (p=0.12). 13 (41%) of 32 cases and none of 62 controls had laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection; crude overall OR 55.5 (95% CI 8.6-infinity); OR 113.3 (95% CI 14.5-infinity) for seven cases with brain abnormalities; and OR 24.7 (95% CI 2.9-infinity) for four cases without brain abnormalities. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that the microcephaly epidemic is a result of congenital Zika virus infection. We await further data from this ongoing study to assess other potential risk factors and to confirm the strength of association in a larger sample size.

S.; de Filippis, A. M.; Jaenisch, T.","BACKGROUND: In 2015, Brazil was faced with the cocirculation of three arboviruses of major public health importance. The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) presents new challenges to both clinicians and public health authorities. Overlapping clinical features between diseases caused by ZIKV, Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) and the lack of validated serological assays for ZIKV make accurate diagnosis difficult. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The outpatient service for acute febrile illnesses in Fiocruz initiated a syndromic clinical observational study in 2007 to capture unusual presentations of DENV infections. In January 2015, an increase of cases with exanthematic disease was observed. Trained physicians evaluated the patients using a detailed case report form that included clinical assessment and laboratory investigations. The laboratory diagnostic algorithm included assays for detection of ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV. 364 suspected cases of Zika virus disease were identified based on clinical criteria between January and July 2015. Of these, 262 (71.9%) were tested and 119 (45.4%) were confirmed by the detection of ZIKV RNA. All of the samples with sequence information available clustered within the Asian genotype. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report of a ZIKV outbreak in the state of Rio de Janeiro, based on a large number of suspected (n = 364) and laboratory confirmed cases (n = 119). We were able to demonstrate that ZIKV was circulating in Rio de Janeiro as early as January 2015. The peak of the outbreak was documented in May/June 2015. More than half of the patients reported headache, arthralgia, myalgia, non-purulent conjunctivitis, and lower back pain, consistent with the case definition of suspected ZIKV disease issued by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). However, fever, when present, was low-intensity and short-termed. In our opinion, pruritus, the second most common clinical sign presented by the confirmed cases, should be added to the PAHO case definition, while fever could be given less emphasis.

An assessment of public health surveillance of Zika virus infection and potentially associated outcomes in Latin America,"Bautista, L. E.; Herrera, V. M.","BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, newborn microcephaly, and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in Latin America may be detected through current surveillance systems, and how cases detected through surveillance may increase health care burden. METHODS: We estimated the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance case definitions using published data. We assumed a 10% ZIKV infection risk during a non-outbreak period and hypothetical increases in risk during an outbreak period. We used sensitivity and specificity estimates to correct for non-differential misclassification, and calculated a misclassification-corrected relative risk comparing both periods. To identify the smallest hypothetical increase in risk resulting in a detectable outbreak we compared the misclassification-corrected relative risk to the relative risk corresponding to the upper limit of the endemic channel (mean + 2 SD). We also estimated the proportion of false positive cases detected during the outbreak. We followed the same approach for microcephaly and GBS, but assumed the risk of ZIKV infection doubled during the outbreak, and ZIKV infection increased the risk of both diseases. RESULTS: ZIKV infection outbreaks were not detectable through non-serological surveillance. Outbreaks were detectable through serologic surveillance if infection risk increased by at least 10%, but more than 50% of all cases were false positive. Outbreaks of severe microcephaly were detected if ZIKV infection increased prevalence of this condition by at least 24.0 times. When ZIKV infection did not increase the prevalence of severe microcephaly, 34.7 to 82.5% of all cases were false positive, depending on diagnostic accuracy. GBS outbreaks were detected if ZIKV infection increased the GBS risk by at least seven times. For optimal GBS diagnosis accuracy, the proportion of false positive cases ranged from 29 to 54% and from 45 to 56% depending on the incidence of GBS mimics. CONCLUSIONS: Current surveillance systems have a low probability of detecting outbreaks of ZIKV infection, severe microcephaly, and GBS, and could result in significant increases in health care burden, due to the detection of large numbers of false positive cases. In view of these limitations, Latin American countries should consider alternative options for surveillance.",2018,May-24,BMC Public Health,18,1,656,29793453,10.1186/s12889-018-5566-7,,#4100,Bautista 2018,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,Reporting rate
Maternal Zika virus infection and newborn microcephaly-an analysis of the epidemiological evidence,"Bautista, L. E.","PURPOSE: To evaluate whether existing data and evidence support a causal link between maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and newborn microcephaly. METHODS: I quantified and compared the prevalence of all and severe microcephaly in Brazil, during and before 2015-2016, to assess whether an outbreak has occurred, used time series analysis to evaluate if the presumed outbreak was linked to a previous outbreak of ZIKV infections, and quantitatively synthesized published data from observational studies testing this association. RESULTS: The prevalences of microcephaly in 2015-2016 were similar or lower than background levels (prevalence ratio [PR] for all microcephaly: 0.19; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.17, 0.20).

In observational studies, the prevalence of microcephaly was not significantly increased in newborns of Zika-infected mothers (average PR: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.84, 2.02).

"Zika virus: Global health challenge, threat and current situation","Aziz, H.; Zia, A.; Anwer, A.; Aziz, M.; Fatima, S.; Faheem, M.","ZIKV has emerged as grave global health issue in the past few years. ZIKV was firstly isolated in 1947 from a rhesus sentinel monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda. It is usually transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and infects skin fibroblasts, skin keratinocytes, etc. ZIKV until now was under reported because of its clinical similarity with the dengue and chikungunya. It is usually spread through the course of the sylvatic cycle. In this cycle, the virus or pathogen lifespan is spent between the wild animal and vectors. The intrinsic incubation period is not yet fully known but it is observed that the very first symptoms of ZIKV infection can appear or develop within 3-12 days of time period and usually subside within 7 days of time. There is a strong relationship between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly; other serious brain anomalies to the infant or newborn are Guillain-Barre syndrome. To date no vaccines are available for ZIKV prevention hence only symptomatic treatment is recommended in infected patients. Usually ZIKV is detected by serologic (IgM ELISA), plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) along with in-house"" molecular techniques (RT-PCR). ZIKV infection being imminent global health issue warrants strong protective measures to prevent it from becoming an epidemic. Early detection and prevention is the key to tackle this grave potential health hazard. J. Med. Virol. 89:943-951, 2017.

M.; Dal Fabbro, M.; Hoscher Romanholi, I.; Venancio da Cunha, R.","BACKGROUND: The current triple epidemic caused by dengue, zika and chikungunya constitutes a serious health problem in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate acute samples (up to the 7 days of symptoms) from patients presenting acute fever syndrome suspected as arboviral infection and characterize the clinical and laboratorial profile during the co-circulation of dengue, zika and chikungunya in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), midwest region of Brazil. METHODS: All suspected cases (n=134) were tested by using serological and molecular diagnostic tests including DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV RT-PCR, Dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen capture ELISA, anti- DENV IgM ELISA and anti-CHIKV IgM ELISA. In addition, clinical, hematological and biochemical parameters of infected patients were analyzed. RESULTS: It was observed that 79.1% of the blood samples were confirmed for ZIKV and/or DENV infection Of those, 38.0% patients were DENV monoinfected, 26.8% were ZIKV monoinfected and 13.4% were DENV/ZIKV co-infected. Seven patients presented Chikungunya IgM antibodies indicating a previous CHIKV infection. Common symptoms included fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, prostration, headache and conjunctivitis. Statistical analysis showed that pruritus and edema were associated with ZIKV infection while prostration and vomiting were more associated with dengue. Additionally, total protein and ALT levels were significantly different in DENV patients compared to ZIKV ones. Some DENV infected patients as well as co-infected needed hospitalization and venous hydration. Otherwise, most ZIKV infected patients presented mild clinical course. Among the pregnant women studied (n=11), three were ZIKV monoinfected while four were DENV monoinfected and two were DENV-1/ZIKV coinfected. In general, normal birth outcomes were observed except for the death due to respiratory insufficiency of one baby born to a mother coinfected with DENV-1/ZIKV. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we provide evidence of the co-circulation of DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV infections in the Campo Grande, MS, Brazil, with a high frequency of DENV-1/ZIKV coinfection. Laboratorial diagnosis poses a challenge where those arboviruses are endemic and differential diagnosis proved to imperative for cases characterization.

"Congenital microcephaly in Quebec: baseline prevalence, risk factors and outcomes in a large cohort of neonates","Auger, N.; Quach, C.; Healy-Profitos, J.; Lowe, A. M.; Arbour, L.","OBJECTIVE: We assessed baseline prevalence, risk factors and outcomes of microcephaly in a large population of neonates. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: All hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: 794 microcephalic and 1 944 010 non-microcephalic infants born between 1989 and 2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline prevalence of microcephaly and occurrence of other congenital anomalies. We estimated the association of (1) pregnancy risk factors including TORCH infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes, other), exposure to teratogens, diabetes and maternal congenital anomalies with risk of microcephaly, and (2) microcephaly with risk of infant mortality and severe morbidity, adjusted for maternal characteristics. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of microcephaly was 4.1 per 10 000, ranging between 3.0 and 5.3 per 10 000 over time. Only 37% of microcephalic infants presented with other congenital anomalies. Maternal infection during pregnancy was the strongest risk factor, with 32 times the risk of microcephaly (prevalence ratio 32.38; 95% CI 22.42 to 46.75) compared with no infection. Exposure to teratogens was the next most important risk factor, with three times greater risk (prevalence ratio 3.10; 95% CI 2.37 to 4.07). Microcephaly was associated with 20 times the risk of infant mortality compared with no microcephaly (prevalence ratio 20.52; 95% CI 15.57 to 27.04) and significantly greater infant morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, infectious exposure during pregnancy is a strong risk factor for microcephaly, and affected infants are at higher risk of poor birth outcomes.

It is the most recent of four surprising appearances of imperative arthropod-borne viral illnesses in the Western Hemisphere over the preceding 20 years. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the existing knowledge about the epidemiology, transmission, clinical manifestations, complications, replication, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment and prevention of ZIKV infection. METHODS: We used electronic databases to identify relevant published data regarding ZIKV in BOOLEAN and MeSH searches. CONCLUSION: This review concludes that the ZIKV predominantly circulates in arboreal mosquitoes (e.g., Aedes africanus) and wild primates. It rarely causes severe infection in humans, even in extremely enzootic regions. Currently, we do not have any efficacious drugs against ZIKV infection.

S.; Ardila-Sierra, A.; Castellanos, G.","PURPOSE: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is an emerging global threat and a public health problem in the Americas. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) has been recently associated to ZIKV. This report presents a case series of GBS possibly associated to ZIKV. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data from patients with GBS treated in 5 intensive care units and with recent history of ZIKV in Cucuta, Colombia were collected from December 1 2015 to April 30 2016. Electrophysiological examination, lumbar puncture, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for ZIKV were performed in 14, 10, and 1 patients, respectively. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with GBS and a recent history of acute viral syndrome compatible with ZIKV infection were studied (mean age, 44 years; range, 17-78). Neurologic symptoms developed at a median of 10 days after the onset of the viral symptoms. Albuminocytological dissociation was found in 8 cases. Electrophysiological criteria for acute motor axonal neuropathy were found in all patients tested. Five patients met level 1, 8 patients level 2, and 6 patients level 3 of diagnostic certainty for GBS in the Brighton classification. Fifteen patients required respiratory assistance, 16 received intravenous immunoglobulins, and 3 had plasmapheresis. Seventy-nine percent of patients were in Hughes GBS disability scale 4 to 5 at discharge and no patients died during the observation period. Acute ZIKV infection, confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, was observed for 1 patient.

Zika virus-associated neurological disorders: a review,"Araujo, A. Q.; Silva, M. T.; Araujo, A. P.","Zika virus, an arbovirus transmitted by mosquitoes of the Aedes species, is now rapidly disseminating throughout the Americas and the ongoing Brazilian outbreak is the largest Zika virus epidemic so far described. In addition to being associated with a non-specific acute febrile illness, a number of neurological manifestations, mainly microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome, have been associated with infection. These with other rarer neurological conditions suggest that Zika virus, similar to other flaviviruses, is neuropathogenic. The surge of Zika virus-related microcephaly cases in Brazil has received much attention and the role of the virus in this and in other neurological manifestations is growing. Zika virus has been shown to be transmitted perinatally and the virus can be detected in amniotic fluid, placenta and foetus brain tissue. A significant increase in Guillain-Barre syndrome incidence has also been reported during this, as well as in previous outbreaks. More recently, meningoencephalitis and myelitis have also been reported following Zika virus infection. In summary, while preliminary studies have suggested a clear relationship between Zika virus infection and certain neurological conditions, only longitudinal studies in this epidemic, as well as experimental studies either in animal models or in vitro, will help to better understand the role of the virus and the pathogenesis of these disorders.",2016,Aug,Brain,139,Pt 8,2122-30,27357348,10.1093/brain/aww158,,#4248,Araujo 2016,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study type (comment, letter, etc); Extractor (2024-09-12 01:01:40)(Select): review; ",
Potential for Zika Virus to Establish a Sylvatic Transmission Cycle in the Americas,"Althouse, B. M.; Vasilakis, N.; Sall, A. A.; Diallo, M.; Weaver, S. C.; Hanley, K. A.","Zika virus (ZIKV) originated and continues to circulate in a sylvatic transmission cycle between non-human primate hosts and arboreal mosquitoes in tropical Africa. Recently ZIKV invaded the Americas, where it poses a threat to human health, especially to pregnant women and their infants. Here we examine the risk that ZIKV will establish a sylvatic cycle in the Americas, focusing on Brazil. We review the natural history of sylvatic ZIKV and present a mathematical dynamic transmission model to assess the probability of establishment of a sylvatic ZIKV transmission cycle in non-human primates and/or other mammals and arboreal mosquito vectors in Brazil. Brazil is home to multiple species of primates and mosquitoes potentially capable of ZIKV transmission, though direct assessment of host competence (ability to mount viremia sufficient to infect a feeding mosquito) and vector competence (ability to become infected with ZIKV and disseminate and transmit upon subsequent feedings) of New World species is lacking. Modeling reveals a high probability of establishment of sylvatic ZIKV across a large range of biologically plausible parameters. Probability of establishment is dependent on host and vector population sizes, host birthrates, and ZIKV force of infection. Research on the host competence of New World monkeys or other small mammals to ZIKV, on vector competence of New World Aedes, Sabethes, and Haemagogus mosquitoes for ZIKV, and on the geographic range of potential New World hosts and vectors is urgently needed. A sylvatic cycle of ZIKV would make future elimination efforts in the Americas practically impossible, and paints a dire picture for the epidemiology of ZIKV and our ability to end the ongoing outbreak of congenital Zika syndrome.",2016,Dec,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,10,12,e0005055,27977671,10.1371/journal.pntd.0005055,,#4291,Althouse 2016,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractorá (2019-08-29 22:40:39)(Select): FOI estimates in animals; ,Spillover

Global spatial assessment of Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus: a scenario of Zika virus exposure,"Alaniz, A. J.; Carvajal, M. A.; Bacigalupo, A.; Cattan, P. E.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Recent scientific evidence on Culex quinquefasciatus has suggested its potential as a vector for ZIKV, which may change the current risk zones. We aimed to quantify the world population potentially exposed to ZIKV in a spatially explicit way, considering the primary vector (A. aegypti) and the potential vector (C. quinquefasciatus). Our model combined species distribution modelling of mosquito species with spatially explicit human population data to estimate ZIKV exposure risk. We estimated the potential global distribution of C. quinquefasciatus and estimated its potential interaction zones with A. aegypti. Then we evaluated the risk zones for ZIKV considering both vectors. Finally, we quantified and compared the people under risk associated with each vector by risk level, country and continent. We found that C. quinquefasciatus had a more temperate distribution until 42 degrees in both hemispheres, while the risk involving A. aegypti is concentrated mainly in tropical latitudes until 35 degrees in both hemispheres. Globally, 4.2 billion people are under risk associated with ZIKV. Around 2.6 billon people are under very high risk associated with C. quinquefasciatus and 1 billion people associated with A. aegypti. Several countries could be exposed to ZIKV, which emphasises the need to clarify the competence of C. quinquefasciatus as a potential vector as soon as possible.

Spatial quantification of the world population potentially exposed to Zika virus,"Alaniz, A. J.; Bacigalupo, A.; Cattan, P. E.","Background: Zika virus is an emerging Flaviviridae virus, which has spread rapidly in the last few years. It has raised concern because it has been associated with fetus microcephaly when pregnant women are infected. The main vector is the mosquito Aedes aegypti , distributed in tropical areas. Methods: Niche modelling techniques were used to estimate the potential distribution area of A. aegypti. This was overlapped with human population density, determining areas of potential transmission risk worldwide. Afterwards, we quantified the population at risk according to risk level. Results: The vector transmission risk is distributed mainly in Asia and Oceania on the shores of the Indian Ocean. In America, the risk concentrates in the Atlantic coast of South America and in the Caribbean Sea shores in Central and North America. In Africa, the major risk is concentrated in the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Central and South Africa. The world population under high and very high risk levels includes 2.261 billion people. Conclusions: These results illustrate Zika virus risk at the global level and provide maps to target the prevention and control measures especially in areas with higher risk, in countries with less sanitation and poorer resources.

METHODS: We used nationally reported cases of symptomatic ZIKV disease among pregnant women and information from the literature on the percent of asymptomatic infections to estimate the number of pregnant women with ZIKV infection occurring August 2015-December 2016. We then estimated the number of infants with congenital microcephaly expected to occur August 2015-August 2017. To compare to the observed counts of infants with congenital microcephaly due to all causes reported through the national birth defects surveillance system, the model was time limited to produce estimates for February-November 2016. FINDINGS: We estimated 1140-2160 (interquartile range [IQR]) infants with congenital microcephaly in Colombia, during August 2015-August 2017, whereas 340-540 infants with congenital microcephaly would be expected in the absence of ZIKV. Based on the time limited version of the model, for February-November 2016, we estimated 650-1410 infants with congenital microcephaly in Colombia. The 95% uncertainty interval for the latter estimate encompasses the 476 infants with congenital microcephaly reported during that approximate time frame based on national birth defects surveillance. INTERPRETATION: Based on modeled estimates, ZIKV infection during pregnancy in Colombia could lead to 3-4 times as many infants with congenital microcephaly in 2015-2017 as would have been expected in the absence of the ZIKV outbreak.

M.; Rivera-Garcia, B.","Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, and infection can be asymptomatic or result in an acute febrile illness with rash (1). Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other severe birth defects (2). Infection has also been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) (3) and severe thrombocytopenia (4,5). In December 2015, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) reported the first locally acquired case of Zika virus infection. This report provides an update to the epidemiology of and public health response to ongoing Zika virus transmission in Puerto Rico (6,7). A confirmed case of Zika virus infection is defined as a positive result for Zika virus testing by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for Zika virus in a blood or urine specimen. A presumptive case is defined as a positive result by Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA)* and a negative result by dengue virus IgM ELISA, or a positive test result by Zika IgM MAC-ELISA in a pregnant woman. An unspecified flavivirus case is defined as positive or equivocal results for both Zika and dengue virus by IgM ELISA. During November 1, 2015-July 7, 2016, a total of 23,487 persons were evaluated by PRDH and CDC Dengue Branch for Zika virus infection, including asymptomatic pregnant women and persons with signs or symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease or suspected GBS; 5,582 (24%) confirmed and presumptive Zika virus cases were identified. Persons with Zika virus infection were residents of 77 (99%) of Puerto Rico's 78 municipalities. During 2016, the percentage of positive Zika virus infection cases among symptomatic males and nonpregnant females who were tested increased from 14% in February to 64% in June. Among 9,343 pregnant women tested, 672 had confirmed or presumptive Zika virus infection, including 441 (66%) symptomatic women and 231 (34%) asymptomatic women. One patient died after developing severe thrombocytopenia (4). Evidence of Zika virus infection or recent unspecified flavivirus infection was detected in 21 patients with confirmed GBS.

An updated review of Zika virus,"Abushouk, A. I.; Negida, A.; Ahmed, H.","The current outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in South America is one of the most serious public health emergencies since the Ebola outbreak of West Africa [2014]. ZIKV belongs to the flaviviridae family and has two lineages (Asian and African). The virus was first discovered in Uganda [1947] and the first human infection was identified in Nigeria [1952]. The current epidemic is the third of its type after that of Yap Island, Micronesia [2007] and French Polynesia [2013]. Phylogenetic studies revealed that the current strain shares about 99.7% of nucleotides and 99.9% of amino acids with the strain of French Polynesia epidemic [2013], suggesting that it has spread across the Pacific Ocean to invade South America. Aedes Aegypti mosquito is the main vector for ZIKV and there are some reports describing possible sexual and maternal to fetal transmission. ZIKV infection is known to be self-limited. However, recent reports suggested that it can be associated with neurological manifestations as Guillan-Barre Syndrome and microcephaly in the newborn population. Currently, vector control seems to be the most effective available preventive measure against ZIKV spread. The development of broad spectrum antivirals and ZIKV vaccines should be a priority of future research.",2016,Nov,J Clin Virol,84,,53-58,27721110,10.1016/j.jcv.2016.09.012,,#4398,Abushouk 2016,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-09-12 00:47:46)(Select): review; ,

C.","BACKGROUND: Widespread transmission of Zika virus in the Americas has occurred since late 2015. We examined demographic and travel-related characteristics of returned Canadian travellers with Zika infection acquired in the Americas to illuminate risk factors for acquisition and the clinical spectrum. METHODS: We analyzed demographic and travel-related data for returned Canadian travellers who presented to a CanTravNet site between October 2015 and September 2016 for care of Zika virus acquired in the Americas. Data were collected with use of the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network data platform. RESULTS: During the study period, 1118 travellers presented to a CanTravNet site after returning from the Americas, 41 (3.7%) of whom had Zika infection. Zika infection from the Americas was diagnosed at CanTravNet sites as often as dengue (n = 41) over the study period. In the first half of the study period, Zika virus burden was borne by people visiting friends and relatives in South America. In the latter half, coincident with the increased spread of Zika throughout the Caribbean and Central America, Zika virus occurred more often in tourists in the Caribbean. Forty (98%) of the travellers with Zika infection acquired it through probable mosquito exposure, and 1 had confirmed sexual acquisition. Congenital transmission occurred in 2 of 3 pregnancies. Two (5%) of those with Zika had symptoms resembling those of Guillain-Barre syndrome, 1 of whom also had Zika viral meningitis. INTERPRETATION: Even in this small cohort, we observed the full clinical spectrum of acute Zika virus, including adverse fetal and neurologic outcomes. Our observations suggest that complications from Zika infection are underestimated by data arising exclusively from populations where Zika is endemic.

G.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has newly emerged as a significant global threat, especially to pregnancy. Recent major outbreaks in the Pacific and in Central and South America have been associated with an increased incidence of microcephaly and other abnormalities of the central nervous system in neonates. The causal link between ZIKV infection during pregnancy and microcephaly is now strongly supported. Over 2 billion people live in regions conducive to ZIKV transmission, with ~4 million infections in the Americas predicted for 2016. Given the scale of the current pandemic and the serious and long-term consequences of infection during pregnancy, the impact of ZIKV on health services and affected communities could be enormous. This further highlights the need for a rapid global public health and research response to ZIKV to limit and prevent its impact through the development of therapeutics, vaccines, and improved diagnostics.

Neurological manifestations of Zika virus infection,"Blazquez, A. B.; Saiz, J. C.","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus (Flaviviridae family) transmitted mainly by Aedes mosquitoes. The virus was restricted to the African continent until its spread to south-east Asia in the 1980's, the Micronesia in 2007, the French Polynesia in 2013 and, more recently in the Americas in 2015, where, up to date, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated about 3-4 million total cases of ZIKV infection. During outbreaks in the French Polynesia and Brazil in 2013 and 2015, respectively, national health authorities reported potential neurological complications of ZIKV disease, chiefly an upsurge in Guillain-Barre syndrome, which coincided with ZIKV outbreaks. On the other hand, the emergence of ZIKV in Brazil has been associated with a striking increase in the number of reported cases of microcephaly in fetus and newborns, twenty times higher than in that reported in previous years. While investigations are currently assessing whether there is an actual association between neurological complications and ZIKV infections, the evidence was enough worrisome for WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern.

Zika Virus Outbreaks: a Narrative Review,"Seshadri, H; Jindal, H; Madan, H; Verma, A; Khan, E; Deb, N; Walecha, A; Suresh, V","Purpose of Review This review aims to comprehensively analyse recent Zika outbreaks and their implications on public health. It discusses the evolving dynamics of the Zika virus transmission, factors contributing to outbreaks, health consequences, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and challenges in controlling its spread. The goal is to provide a multidisciplinary understanding of Zika virus and guide public health strategies for effective outbreak prevention and management.Recent Findings Recent findings reveal sporadic Zika cases with mild symptomatology. Major outbreaks occurred in the Yap Islands (2007), French Polynesia (2013-2014), and the Americas (2015-2016) with increased microcephaly cases. Recent research focuses on vaccine development, antiviral drugs, and point-of-care diagnostics. However, knowledge gaps remain in transmission dynamics, immune response, and long-term outcomes of Zika virus infection.Summary Zika virus, which has sporadically prevailed in regions of Africa and Asia and causes mild febrile illness to asymptomatic cases, has expanded, leading to major outbreaks. Recent outbreaks include Yap Islands (2007), the first to occur outside Asia and Africa. In 2013, the Oceania outbreak showed neurological manifestations for the first time. The Americas outbreak (2015-2016) is considered the largest Zika epidemic with a spike in microcephaly cases, resulting in WHO declaring Zika-associated microcephaly a public health emergency of international concern.

Disease Transmission and Diagnosis of Zika Virus,"Bhandari, V; Taksande, AB; Sapkale, B","An arbovirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family and the Flavivirus genus, the Zika virus (ZIKV), has profoundly transformed global health perception. Historically, ZIKV infections were considered infrequent, with generally mild manifestations. However, this perception changed dramatically when the virus quickly spread from Asia to the Americas, impacting many nations. It was alarming that there was a connection between ZIKV infection in pregnant women and the beginning of microcephaly in their offspring. ZIKV control and treatment are further complicated because Aedes mosquitoes, which primarily bite during the day, are the primary vectors of the virus. ZIKV diagnostic processes are complex since the virus shares symptoms with other illnesses like dengue and chikungunya. Despite the effectiveness of current diagnostic methods like real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), there is a clear need for more accurate antibody tests. This is especially true given that many people undergo testing while asymptomatic or after the ideal detection window. The capacity of ZIKV to infect human-derived neural progenitor cells raises worrying possibilities for severe neurological effects. With all these characteristics and their connection to birth abnormalities, research efforts into the virus's efficient treatment and prevention have increased. Overall, the emergence of ZIKV has demonstrated the necessity of a comprehensive and team-based strategy to address its myriad problems. This entails comprehending its transmission dynamics, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and creating efficient therapies and preventive measures, all crucial to lessening the threat that ZIKV poses to the world's health.",2023,,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,15,11,,WOS:001110704400020,10.7759/cureus.49263,,#5570,Bhandari 2023,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-03-23 03:26:51)(Screen): review; ,

Zika virus causes a viral disease transmitted to humans mainly by the infected Aedes mosquito bite. The infection is not severe in most cases; however, there is evidence that infection during pregnancy may be associated with fetal genetic abnormalities (including microcephaly). In addition to microcephaly and other malformations, some specific lesions in the central nervous system have been reported.

"Identifying hidden Zika hotspots in Pernambuco, Brazil: a spatial analysis","Freitas, LP; Lowe, R; Koepp, AE; Alves, SV; Dondero, M; Marteleto, LJ","Background Northeast Brazil has the world's highest rate of Zika-related microcephaly. However, Zika case counts cannot accurately describe burden because mandatory reporting was only established when the epidemic was declining in the region. Methods To advance the study of the Zika epidemic, we identified hotspots of Zika in Pernambuco state, Northeast Brazil, using Aedes-borne diseases (dengue, chikungunya and Zika) and microcephaly data. We used Kulldorff's Poisson purely spatial scan statistic to detect low- and high-risk clusters for Aedes-borne diseases (2014-2017) and for microcephaly (2015-2017), separately. Municipalities were classified according to a proposed gradient of Zika burden during the epidemic, based on the combination of cluster status in each analysis and considering the strength of the evidence. Results We identified 26 Aedes-borne diseases clusters (11 high-risk) and 5 microcephaly clusters (3 high-risk) in Pernambuco. According to the proposed Zika burden gradient, our results indicate that the northeast of Pernambuco and the Sertao region were hit hardest by the Zika epidemic.

There are limited data on the natural history of antenatal Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure in twin pregnancies, especially regarding intertwin concordance of prenatal, placental, and infant outcomes.Methods. This prospective cohort study included twin pregnancies referred to a single institution from September 2015 to June 2016 with maternal ZIKV. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of maternal, placental, and neonatal samples was performed. Prenatal ultrasounds were completed for each twin, and histomorphologic analysis was performed for each placenta. Abnormal neonatal outcome was defined as abnormal exam and/or abnormal imaging. Two- to three-year follow-up of infants included physical exams, neuroimaging, and Bayley-III developmental assessment.Results. Among 244 pregnancies, 4 twin gestations without coinfection were identified. Zika virus infection occurred at 16-33 weeks gestation. Zika virus PCR testing revealed discordance between dichorionic twins, between placentas in a dichorionic pair, between portions of a monochorionic placenta, and between a neonate and its associated placenta. Of the 8 infants, 3 (38%) had an abnormal neonatal outcome. Of 6 infants with long-term follow-up, 3 (50%) have demonstrated ZIKV-related abnormalities.Conclusions. Neonatal PCR testing, placental findings, and infant outcomes can be discordant between co-twins with antenatal ZIKV exposure. These findings demonstrate that each twin should be evaluated independently for vertical transmission.",2020,,JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES,221,11,1838-1845,WOS:000537458000014,10.1093/infdis/jiz629,,#5636,Sobhani 2020,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
An epidemiological survey of the current status of Zika and the immune interaction between dengue and Zika infection in Southern Taiwan,"Wang, WH; Urbina, AN; Wu, CC; Lin, CY; Thitithanyanont, A; Assavalapsakul, W; Lu, PL; Chen, YH; Wang, SF","Objectives: This study was performed to examine the current status of Zika and the effects of pre-existing dengue immunity on Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in Southern Taiwan.Methods: A phylogenetic tree was used to analyze the phylogeny of detected ZIKVs. Paired sera from dengue patients were collected for the determination of dengue and Zika infection. Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the titers of neutralizing antibodies and viruses, respectively. An antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) assay was used to evaluate the effect of anti-dengue antibodies on ZIKV infection.Results: Epidemiological data indicated the continuous importation of ZIKV infection from neighboring Zika epidemic countries into Taiwan. A total of 78 dengue patients were enrolled and 21 paired serum samples were obtained. PRNT90 results for the 21 samples identified eight cases of primary dengue infection and 13 cases of secondary dengue infection; two samples were positive for ZIKV (MR766). Results from the ADE assay indicated that convalescent sera from primary and secondary dengue infection patients displayed significant ADE of the ZIKV infection when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05).Conclusions: This study suggests that pre-existing dengue immunity facilitates ZIKV infection and that the continuous importation of ZIKV infection may pose a threat to indigenous Zika emergence in Southern Taiwan.

The expanding arms of Zika virus: An updated review with recent Indian outbreaks,"Agarwal, A; Chaurasia, D","Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks and their adverse clinical consequences have raised concerns throughout the world. ZIKV was little known during the initial outbreaks in Yap islands and French Polynesia, but it came to attention after the series of Brazil outbreaks in which severe complications like microcephaly in newborn babies was detected. During 2018, outbreaks of ZIKV occurred in two states of India which, being a tropical country, has congenial climatic conditions, abundance of highly competent mosquito vectors such asAedes aegyptiandAedes albopictus, and an immunologically naive population. In this review, we will briefly discuss the history, epidemiology, evolution, transmission (vector-borne and non-vector borne), pathogenesis, clinical signs and unusual presentations, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of ZIKV.

EVIDENCE-BASED PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY FOR ZIKA INFECTION MANAGEMENT IN MALAYSIA,"Mun, WC; Hod, R; Hassan, MR; Shamsusah, NA; Agustar, HK; Puteh, SEW","Zika has re-emerged as a pandemic between year 2007-2018. Research progress on Zika is much slower in the Asia region compared to America counterpart and there is much under-reporting and inadequate preparedness for any future Zika outbreak. A review of current disease management policies/guidelines can provide evidence-based information to improve preparedness and response to Zika epidemic in Malaysia. A systematic literature search using a Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) framework and a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) workflow across four scientific databases and snowball sampling review of guidelines from international health authorities yielded 189 relevant articles from 2013-2018, from which 37 articles screened by titles fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were subjected to abstract scrutiny, resulting in eight articles for full text analysis using a Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment system of Cochrane's checklist. Meticulous, systematic quality ratings conducted by independent reviewers yielded four important Zika intervention domains. Narrative and qualitative assessments on their effectiveness in intervention and relevant public health effects were evaluated. Two domains, namely, vaccine development and blood product management, were rated as having a high quality of evidence, and therefore considered critically important to the management of Zika and were strongly recommended for implementation by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. The other two domains, vector control and family planning, were deemed important and were recommended, if feasible, for inclusion into a Zika management program. In conclusion, evaluation of the scientific quality in disease management produced four domains, inclusion of which into public health policies should strengthen the preparedness and management of future Zika epidemic in Malaysia.",2021,,SOUTHEAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH,52,5,696-716,WOS:000746102700001,,,#5653,Mun 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
A study on Zika-Dengue coinfection model with microcephaly newborn dynamics,"Zevika, M; Kusdiantara, R; Nuraini, N; Soewono, E","A study of data on the Zika outbreak in Brazil in 2015-2016 provides knowledge that Zika infection can trigger brain disorders such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome in adults and microcephaly in newborns. Zika infection is a vector-borne disease most commonly transmitted to humans through an infected Aedes mosquito bite, which is also the primary vector for dengue. Thus, many cases of these two diseases were recorded in the same population. In this study, we formulated a Zika-dengue coinfection model that describes the combined dynamics of Zika and dengue, involving the birth of microcephaly-malformed infants from pregnant women infected with the Zika virus. The analysis of the model states that three equilibrium points can be calculated explicitly, namely a disease-free equilibrium point and two boundary endemic equilibrium points. In addition, there is one implicit coinfection equilibrium point. The basic reproduction number is obtained along with the stability of disease-free equilibrium. Condition for the instability of the two boundary equilibria is obtained. This condition allows for a bifurcation point in the numerical exploration of the coinfection equilibrium point and its stability properties. The numerical simulation shows that the coinfection point appears when the two boundary equilibria are unstable. In addition, two Hopf bifurcation points are found with stable limit cycles between them.",2023,,CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS,175,,,WOS:001149903000001,10.1016/j.chaos.2023.114019,,#5656,Zevika 2023,Exclusion reason: Co-infection study; ,

Although it is imported in Spain, there is a risk of autochthonous transmission due to Aedes albopictus presence. Zika disease and congenital cases have been under surveillance since 2016. The objective of this study is to explore the epidemiology of disease and pregnancies result.Material and methods: A descriptive study was carried out into cases reported to the National Surveillance Network (RENAVE) during the 30/11/2015 to 31/12/2017 period. The case definition and the survey are included in the RENAVE protocol. The variables were: date; notifying region (Autonomous Community (AC)); pregnancy and its evolution; case classification; mode of transmission; country or region of infection; socio-demographical, clinical and microbiological data. A descriptive analysis of the cases and their distribution according to the other variables was carried out.Results: A total of 512 cases were reported by 17 ACs. 507 were non-congenital, of which 327 (64.5%) were women (52.5% of childbearing age). 403 cases (79.5%) corresponded to 2016 and 193 (38.1%) resided in regions with A. albopictus presence between May and October. 96.1% of imported cases were infected in America (51.7% while visiting relatives). Three cases (3.9%) of congenital Zika virus infection were detected among 77 pregnant women.Conclusions: The evolution of reported cases was in accordance with that of the epidemic in America. The largest group of travellers was young women who travelled to Latin America on family visits. Pregnancy monitoring resulted in the identification of Zika related foetal complications.

Neuroinfection and neurological pathologies by the Zika virus. A review,"Briones, R; Cobeña, M; Moreira, V","The pathogenesis of the Zika Virus (ZIKV) is currently not well understood. However, studies have suggested that it begins when dendritic cells are infected near the site of inoculation of the bite of the mosquito infected with the virus; later it spreads through the lymph nodes and finally to the bloodstream, through which it comes to exert its action. The objective of this article is to describe the mechanism of neuroinfection and neurological pathologies caused by the Zika virus, for which a systematic bibliographic review was carried out. Within this pathogenic action, its predilection for nervous tissues stands out, accepting flavivirus as highly neurotropic. The main route is neuroinvasion as a process that involves multiple steps in the disruption of hetinetic intercellular junctions, through the alteration of claudin and its passage through the blood-brain barrier, the choroid plexuses and the glia; this favors the neurological alterations produced as a result of in utero infection. Of these alterations, microcephaly is the most important, which is why the suspicion that there is a relationship between Zika virus infection and microcephaly, as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome, myelitis and viral meningoencephalitis, which locates the virus as the neurotrope par excellence. In conclusion, the data point to an important association between Zika infection and neurological pathology, which is why it represents a target of study in order to prevent its transmission and reduce development during pregnancy.",2021,,REVISTA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DEL ZULIA,12,33,310-322,WOS:000656832200022,10.46925//rdluz.33.22,,#5666,Briones 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Crossover behavior of the Zika virus infection and the delayed immune response,"Arif, R; Fahmy, MA; Amin, N; Farwa, S; Sohail, A; Gepreel, KA","The control of the transmission of viruses is really challenging. Zika virus is the twentieth among the most deadly viruses in world's history. With the advancement in research and technology several epidemiological issues are controlled, yet the vector borne diseases have remained a great challenge and the most effective approach to control its spread is to strictly adhere to the precautionary measures. Computational framework is ideal to forecast the impact of precautionary measures on the crossover behavior of the Zika virus and the delay in population growth, caused by such viruses. During this research, a delayed computational model is studied and the dynamical analysis with useful thresholds are reported. The compartmental model is comprised of the interactions of Zika virus infected cells and the short lived effector cells. Based on the fetal abnormalities, associated with the Zika virus infection, delayed pregnancy is recommended by WHO. The impact of the Zika virus to the delayed pregnancies, to avoid such fetal complications is demonstrated with the aid of dynamical analysis of interactions with delay at the inter-cellular levels. The dynamics are depicted numerically relative to key parameters and useful conclusions are drawn.",2022,,RESULTS IN PHYSICS,41,,,WOS:000859195700002,10.1016/j.rinp.2022.105892,,#5669,Arif 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Describe the sociodemographic profile of mothers of children with congenital Zika syndrome.Method. This is a descriptive, cross-sectional, quantitative study. The 39 mothers of live born babies among the cases notified in 2015 and 2016 with confirmed diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil, were invited to participate. Of these, 25 mothers were enrolled. Data were collected using a socioeconomic questionnaire and a field diary.Results. Skin color was self-reported as non-white by 19/25 mothers (74.0%), and 16 (64.0%) reported having a partner. Regarding schooling, 12 (48.0%) had completed high school. Per capita income varied from no income to US$ 1 111.11, and ranged from none to US$ 61.72 for 12 women (48.0%). Seventeen women (68.0%) lived in underprivileged periphery areas with poor living conditions. Of the 25 women, 16 (64.0%) had a job prior to the pregnancy; and of these, 12 (75.0%) were fired or quit after the baby was born.Conclusions. The profile of mothers shows that the Zika epidemics was not equanimous and preferentially affected women with low income and lower social class. In this sense, we believe that congenital Zika syndrome may be determined by social inequalities in Brazil.

Prevalence of sleep disorders in children with Congenital Zika Syndrome,"Tavares, CSS; Marques, RS; Santos, VS; Santos, HP Jr; Reis, MCD; Martins, PR","Studies have reported that children with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS) experience changes in their sleep patterns, which can result in mood disturbances, behavioral issues and delays in growth and development. This systematic review synthesized the available evidence on the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with CZS. Eligible studies were those with an observational design that reported sleep disorders in children with CZS using validated questionnaires, polysomnography/electroencephalographic recording or parent/caregiver reports. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS and Embase, as well as a gray literature search using Google Scholar. The Freeman-Tukey double-arcsine transformation with a random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of sleep disorders with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Five studies were included and data from 340 Brazilian children with CZS were analyzed. The overall prevalence of sleep disorders was 27.4% (95% CI 16.7-39.4), without differences among studies using validated questionnaires (29.4%, 95% CI 21.4-37.8) or report from parents and caregivers (27.4%, 95% CI 11.5-47.0). Sleep disorders are prevalent in children with CZS, impacting their development and quality of life. It is critical to examine the quality of sleep in these children to develop appropriate interventions that can mitigate these issues.The article discusses a systematic review of studies that have explored the prevalence of sleep disorders in children with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), a condition caused by the Zika virus. The study found that children with CZS often experience changes in their sleep patterns, which can lead to mood disturbances, behavioral issues and delays in growth and development. The review included five studies with a total of 340 Brazilian children with CZS, and the overall prevalence of sleep disorders was found to be 27.4%. This indicates that sleep disorders are prevalent in children with CZS and can significantly impact their development and quality of life.

Dynamics analysis of a Zika-dengue co-infection model with dengue vaccine and antibody-dependent enhancement,"Wang, LP; Zhao, HY","Mounting clinical and experimental evidence indicates that antibodies against dengue can enhance Zika infection through the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) mechanism. ADE is an alarming evolutionary development that makes it difficult to develop a vaccination campaign against dengue. To better understand the effect of dengue vaccine and ADE on a Zika and dengue outbreak, we formulate a Zika-dengue co-infection model that describes the joint dynamics of Zika and dengue. We derive the basic and invasion reproduction numbers, which are threshold values to identify the existence and stability of a disease-free state and two boundary equilibrium points, where only one strain (Zika or dengue) is present, and to identify the persistence of disease. Our analysis and numerical simulations suggest that although vaccination against dengue has a positive effect on the control of dengue, it has a negative effect on the control of Zika, and the increasing level of ADE induces a large number of accumulated Zika cases. Later, in this paper, criteria of vaccination against dengue strategies are established for disease eradication. Finally, the model is applied to simulate the accumulated cases of Zika and dengue in Brazil from February 19, 2016 to April 14, 2018. Based on the parameters estimated, we obtain that in Brazil the dengue epidemic is endemic whereas the Zika epidemic will eventually disappear. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

With the domesticated Aedes aegypti mosquito as its vector, it is widely assumed that Zika virus transmission occurs within the household and/or via human mobility. We investigated these assumptions by using viral genomes to trace Zika transmission spatially.Methods: We analysed serum samples from 119 paediatric Zika cases participating in the long-standing Paediatric Dengue Cohort Study in Managua, which was expanded to include Zika in 2015. An optimal spanning directed tree was constructed by minimizing the differences in viral sequence diversity composition between patient nodes, where low-frequency variants were used to increase the resolution of the inferred Zika outbreak dynamics.Findings: Out of the 18 houses where pairwise difference in sample collection dates among all the household members was within 30 days, we only found two where viruses from individuals within the same household were up to 10th-most closely linked to each other genetically. We also identified a substantial number of transmission events involving long geographical distances (n=30), as well as potential super-spreading events in the estimated transmission tree.Interpretation: Our finding highlights that community transmission, often involving long geographical distances, played a much more important role in epidemic spread than within-household transmission.

Inferring <i>who</i>-<i>infected</i>-<i>whom</i>-<i>where</i> in the 2016 Zika outbreak in Singapore-a spatio-temporal model,"Prem, K; Lau, MSY; Tam, CC; Ho, MZJ; Ng, LC; Cook, AR","Singapore experienced its first known Zika outbreak in 2016. Given the lack of herd immunity, the suitability of the climate for pathogen transmission, and the year-round presence of the vector-Aedes aegypti-Zika had the potential to become endemic, like dengue. Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly are severe complications associated elsewhere with Zika and the risk of these complications makes understanding its spread imperative. We investigated the spatio-temporal spread of locally transmitted Zika in Singapore and assessed the relevance of non-residential transmission of Zika virus infections, by inferring the possible infection tree (i.e. who-infected-whom-where) and comparing inferences using geographically resolved data on cases' home, their work, or their home and work. We developed a spatio-temporal model using time of onset and both addresses of the Zika-confirmed cases between July and September 2016 to estimate the infection tree using Bayesian data augmentation. Workplaces were involved in a considerable fraction (64.2%) of infections, and homes and workplaces may be distant relative to the scale of transmission, allowing ambulant infected persons may act as the 'vector' infecting distant parts of the country. Contact tracing is a challenge for mosquito-borne diseases, but inferring the geographically structured transmission tree sheds light on the spatial transmission of Zika to immunologically naive regions of the country.",2019,,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE,16,155,,WOS:000473756800001,10.1098/rsif.2018.0604,,#5724,Prem 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-09-30 19:24:55)(Select): Ruth and I agreed - nothing to extract; ,
"A Survey on Zika Virus Infection as a Global Emergency, a Mosquito-Borne Flavivirus","Kassiri, H; Dehghani, R; Kasiri, M; Dehghani, M; Kasiri, R","Introduction and Objectives: The spread of the Zika virus throughout Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania and the reported outbreaks of the Zika virus disease has turned this virus into a public health emergency of international concern. Given the significance of this disease and its spread across the world, this study investigated the history, epidemiology, symptoms, vectors, reservoirs, transmission methods, virus characteristics, and control, and it's status in Iran and the rest of the world. Materials and Methods: Some keywords such as Zika virus, neurodegenerative disorders, global distribution, vector and control were used to search the Internet and authentic medical journals in scientific databases for papers submitted from 2009 to 2019. Seventy-one articles were found of which 52 were selected considering the objectives of the study. These researches were studied and criticized while introducing the Zika virus disease. Results: This virus is broadly similar to the Dengue virus in terms of epidemiological indicators and transmission cycle in urban areas. It causes mild illness in most cases, but infection during pregnancy can lead to congenital birth defects. Several mosquito species have been identified as vectors for the Zika virus. It is also transmitted through breast milk, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse, and from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery. The virus is also transmitted transovarially to the eggs of the infected mosquitoes. There is currently no vaccine to prevent Zika and no medicine to treat it. Conclusions: Travels to regions where there is an active Zika virus and its transmission is common can increase the risk of transmission of this virus to Iran. Consequently, careful supervision along the borders and the airports when foreigners enter the country is essential.",2020,,ENTOMOLOGY AND APPLIED SCIENCE LETTERS,7,2,51-57,WOS:000584634100007,,,#5729,Kassiri 2020,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-03-22 03:14:29)(Screen): review; ,Review
"Democratizing Public Health: Participatory Policymaking Institutions, Mosquito Control, and Zika in the Americas","Touchton, M; Wampler, B","The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne virus spread primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. Zika cases have been detected throughout the mosquito's range, with an epidemic occurring from 2015 to 2017 in Brazil. Many Zika cases are mild or asymptomatic, but infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly in children, and a small percentage of cases result in Guillan-Barre syndrome. There is currently little systematic information surrounding the municipal spread of the Zika Virus in Brazil. This article uses coarsened exact matching with negative binomial estimation and ordinary least squares estimation to assess the determinants of Zika incidence across the similar to 280,000 cases confirmed and recorded by Brazil's Ministry of Health in 2016 and 2017. These data come from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests in Brazil and have not been published. We use data on the universe of individual Zika cases in Brazil and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software to examine the virus at the municipal level across 5570 municipalities and construct a unique, unusually rich dataset covering daily Zika transmission. Additionally, our dataset includes corresponding local data on democratic governance, mosquito control efforts, and environmental conditions to estimate their relationship to Zika transmission. The results demonstrate that the presence of subnational democratic, participatory policymaking institutions and high levels of local state capacity are associated with low rates of Zika contraction. These models control for local healthcare spending and economic conditions, among other factors, that also influence Zika contraction rates. In turn, these findings provide a better understanding of what works for local health governance and mosquito control and makes important data public so that scholars and practitioners can perform their own analyses. Stronger models of Zika transmission will then inform mosquito abatement efforts across the Global South, as well as provide a blueprint for combatting Dengue fever, which is also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes.",2023,,TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE,8,1,,WOS:000918270000001,10.3390/tropicalmed8010038,,#5730,Touchton 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-22 00:14:22)(Select): model?; Extractor (2024-08-22 00:13:14)(Select): data from other sources; ,
Ensemble forecasting of the Zika space-time spread with topological data analysis,"Soliman, M; Lyubchich, V; Gel, YR","As per the records of the World Health Organization, the first formally reported incidence of Zika virus occurred in Brazil in May 2015. The disease then rapidly spread to other countries in Americas and East Asia, affecting more than 1,000,000 people. Zika virus is primarily transmitted through bites of infected mosquitoes of the species Aedes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus). The abundance of mosquitoes and, as a result, the prevalence of Zika virus infections are common in areas which have high precipitation, high temperature, and high population density. Nonlinear spatio-temporal dependency of such data and lack of historical public health records make prediction of the virus spread particularly challenging. In this article, we enhance Zika forecasting by introducing the concepts of topological data analysis and, specifically, persistent homology of atmospheric variables, into the virus spread modeling. The topological summaries allow for capturing higher order dependencies among atmospheric variables that otherwise might be unassessable via conventional spatio-temporal modeling approaches based on geographical proximity assessed via Euclidean distance. We introduce a new concept of cumulative Betti numbers and then integrate the cumulative Betti numbers as topological descriptors into three predictive machine learning models: random forest, generalized boosted regression, and deep neural network.

ZIKV infection in pregnancy can have serious implications on the fetus and the neonate. Vertical transmission to the fetus can occur irrespective of symptomatic or asymptomatic infection in the pregnant woman and the risk can persist throughout pregnancy. The exact frequency of maternal-to-fetal transmission of Zika virus is difficult to determine accurately. The greatest risk of serious fetal sequelae is seen if the infection occurs within the first and second trimester. However, they can also be seen with infections in the third trimester. This document describes the presentation, feto-maternal manifestations, role of prenatal Ultrasound in diagnosis of infection, testing methods and the management in pregnancy and screening in the neonatal period.

Zika virus disease: an alarming situation resurfacing on the radar - a short communication,"Shariff, S; Kantawala, B; Hamiidah, N; Yadav, T; Nazir, A; Uwishema, O","Background/introduction:On the 13th of December 2022, a 5-year-old girl from Karnataka, India, tested positive for Zika virus. The first Zika virus was isolated from the serum of a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947. Zika virus was largely dormant for about 70 years before suddenly resurfacing across all of America, from Brazil to the Pacific Islands and is connected to a grouping of microcephaly phenotypes based on a complete virus genome analysis. All of the aforementioned research provides an overview of the migration of this virus from the Americas to continental Africa via mosquitoes. The current study, therefore, aims to evaluate the virologic characteristics, prophylaxis, transmitting mechanisms, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of ZIKV infection in light of the virus's widespread dissemination and deadly nature.Aim:The investigation's findings aim to demonstrate that in order to prevent further outbreaks, there is a national requirement for active epidemiological and entomological observation of Zika.Materials and methods:Data were extracted from academic journals of medicine published in MEDLINE, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Ovid, and Embase inventory databases with a predetermined search strategy. Articles considering the Zika virus and its clinical manifestations, especially neurological, were included.Results:The Zika virus has been declared a public health emergency of global significance by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is of alarming concern that it is now one of the most prevalent infectious diseases associated with birth abnormalities discovered in the past five decades. The onset and accelerated spread of disease to other parts of the world is attributed to the migration of infected hosts and climate change. Rapid laboratory diagnosis, evaluation of serological techniques, and virus isolation are urgently needed, along with newer modalities such as mathematical modeling as prediction devices to curb this issue. Due to its grave neurological manifestations, it is mandated to engineer peptide therapies and a virus-specific vaccination to treat this neurotropic virus.Conclusion:There is currently no vaccination against Zika virus infection. If societies are not adequately prepared, the epidemiological wave will have an impact on the workforce and could pose a serious threat.

"ENTOMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION FOLLOWING A ZIKA OUTBREAK IN BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS","Mutebi, JP; Godsey, M; Rose, D; Barnes, F; Rodriguez, J; Presas, YE; Qualls, W; Bolling, B; Rodriguez, A","In November and December 2016, an outbreak of locally transmitted Zika occurred in Brownsville, TX. The Texas Department of State Health Services requested for a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Epi Aid, and as part of that Epi Aid a team of CDC entomologists was deployed in January 2017. The mission was to improve mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance and evaluate the possibility of continuing local Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission in the city. The mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance program was expanded from 4 to 40 BG-Sentinel traps evenly distributed throughout the city. Over a 2-wk period, 15 mosquito species were detected; the most abundant species were Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Ae. albopictus, which accounted for 66.7%, 16.2%, and 5.7% of the total mosquito collection, respectively. The relative abundance of Ae. aegypti (1.0 mosquitoes/trap/day) and Ae. albopictus (0.4 mosquitoes/trap/day) was very low and unlikely to initiate and/or sustain ZIKV transmission. Zika virus was not detected in the mosquitoes collected, suggesting no or extremely low ZIKV transmission at that time.",2021,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION,37,4,286-290,WOS:000727198100013,,,#5769,Mutebi 2021,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,
A dynamic neural network model for predicting risk of Zika in real time,"Akhtar, M; Kraemer, MUG; Gardner, LM","Background In 2015, the Zika virus spread from Brazil throughout the Americas, posing an unprecedented challenge to the public health community. During the epidemic, international public health officials lacked reliable predictions of the outbreak's expected geographic scale and prevalence of cases, and were therefore unable to plan and allocate surveillance resources in a timely and effective manner. Methods In this work, we present a dynamic neural network model to predict the geographic spread of outbreaks in real time. The modeling framework is flexible in three main dimensions (i) selection of the chosen risk indicator, i.e., case counts or incidence rate; (ii) risk classification scheme, which defines the high-risk group based on a relative or absolute threshold; and (iii) prediction forecast window (1 up to 12 weeks). The proposed model can be applied dynamically throughout the course of an outbreak to identify the regions expected to be at greatest risk in the future. Results The model is applied to the recent Zika epidemic in the Americas at a weekly temporal resolution and country spatial resolution, using epidemiological data, passenger air travel volumes, and vector habitat suitability, socioeconomic, and population data for all affected countries and territories in the Americas. The model performance is quantitatively evaluated based on the predictive accuracy of the model. We show that the model can accurately predict the geographic expansion of Zika in the Americas with the overall average accuracy remaining above 85% even for prediction windows of up to 12 weeks. Conclusions Sensitivity analysis illustrated the model performance to be robust across a range of features. Critically, the model performed consistently well at various stages throughout the course of the outbreak, indicating its potential value at any time during an epidemic. The predictive capability was superior for shorter forecast windows and geographically isolated locations that are predominantly connected via air travel. The highly flexible nature of the proposed modeling framework enables policy makers to develop and plan vector control programs and case surveillance strategies which can be tailored to a range of objectives and resource constraints.",2019,,BMC MEDICINE,17,1,,WOS:000483649100001,10.1186/s12916-019-1389-3,,#5777,Akhtar 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-05-14 02:49:23)(Select): model but not a transmission model; no parameters; ,
Zika virus in Brazil and worldwide: a narrative review,"Martins, MM; Medronho, RD; Cunha, ANJLAD","Background In the past 5 years, the Zika virus (ZIKV) has gone from being associated with mild infection to one of the most studied viruses worldwide. Between 2015 and 2016, the first reports of pregnant women with confirmed and/or suspected ZIKV infection described fetuses and newborns with severe congenital malformations, in particular microcephaly and central nervous system malformations, leading to a strong suspicion of its association with the virus. Despite all the knowledge rapidly acquired since the beginning of the ZIKV outbreak, many questions are still to be answered and further studies on the infection and its consequences are required.Aim: To present the currently available evidence on the epidemiological and clinical aspects of ZIKV infection.Methods: Non-systematic review carried out in MEDLINE (PubMed), LILACS (VHL), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane and CAPES Portal databases for the past five years using the search terms arboviruses, flavivirus, Zika and ZIKV.Results: The acute clinical of ZIKV infection in children seems very similar to that in adults, with fever (usully low), rash maculopapular and pruritus. Neurological complication associated with ZIKV reported in the literature include Guillain-Barre syndrome and meningoencephalitis. More recently, the term congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) has been adopted to describe a set of symptoms and signs in children whose mothers had ZIKV infection confirmed during pregnancy.Conclusions: More detailed knowledge of ZIKV infection in children allows the pediatrician to diagnose earlier, implement the correct treatment, monitor warnings signs for the most severe forms, and especially establish effective preventive measures.",2021,,PAEDIATRICS AND INTERNATIONAL CHILD HEALTH,41,1,28-35,WOS:000547781300001,10.1080/20469047.2020.1776044,,#5783,Martins 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Quantifying the risk of Zika virus spread in Asia during the 2015-16 epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean: A modeling study,"Luo, XS; Imai, N; Dorigatti, I","Background: No large-scale Zika epidemic has been observed to date in Southeast Asia following the 2015-16 Latin American and the Caribbean epidemic. One hypothesis is Southeast Asian populations' partial immunity to Zika.Method: We estimated the two conditions for a Zika outbreak emergence in Southeast Asia: (i) the risk of Zika introduction from Latin America and the Caribbean and, (ii) the risk of autochthonous transmission under varying assumptions on population immunity. We also validated the model used to estimate the risk of introduction by comparing the estimated number of Zika seeds introduced into the United States with case counts reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Results: There was good agreement between our estimates and case counts reported by the CDC. We thus applied the model to Southeast Asia and estimated that, on average, 1-10 seeds were introduced into Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. We also found increasing population immunity levels from 0 to 90% reduced probability of autochthonous transmission by 40% and increasing individual variation in transmission further reduced the outbreak probability.Conclusions: Population immunity, combined with heterogeneity in transmission, can explain why no large-scale outbreak was observed in Southeast Asia during the 2015-16 epidemic.",2020,,TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE,33,,,WOS:000517778600024,10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101562,,#5802,Luo 2020,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-21 22:57:48)(Select): risk factor??; ,

Zika virus as an emerging arbovirus of international public health concern,"Vaziri, S; Pour, SH; Akrami-Mohajeri, F","Zika virus (ZIKV) was identified in 1947 in a rhesus monkey during an investigation of the yellow fever virus in the Zika Forest of Uganda; it was also isolated later from humans in Nigeria. The main distribution areas of ZIKV were the African mainland and South-East Asia in the 1980s, Micronesia in 2007, and more recently the Americas in 2014. ZIKV belongs to the Flaviviridae family and Flavivirus genus. ZIKV infection, which is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, is an emerging arbovirus disease. The clinical symptoms of ZIKV infection are fever, headache, rashes, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis, which clinically resemble dengue fever syndrome. Sometimes, ZIKV infection has been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly. At the end of 2015, following an increase in cases of ZIKV infection associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly in newborns in Brazil, the World Health Organization declared a global emergency.

We analysed the data from all the patients with GBS diagnosis that were admitted to a referral hospital, in Tapachula City during the period from January 2013 to August 2016, comparing the incidence of GBS according to the temporality of the Zika outbreak in Southern Mexico. Additionally, we described the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the GBS patients admitted before or after the Zika outbreak. We observed a sharp increase in the number of patients hospitalised due to GBS from the time the first confirmed Zika cases appeared in Mexico. Clinically we observed GBS cases before zika outbreak had more frequently history of respiratory/gastrointestinal symptoms and GBS during zika outbreak had significantly more frequently recent history of rash/conjunctivitis.

We conducted a cohort study in Mexico to evaluate the natural history of Zika infection. We describe here the frequency of Zika, chikungunya and dengue virus infections immediately after Zika introduction in Mexico, and baseline characteristics of participants for each type of infection. Methods Prospective, observational cohort evaluating the natural history of Zika virus infection in the Mexico-Guatemala border area. Patients with fever, rash or both, meeting the modified criteria of PAHO for probable Zika cases were enrolled (June 2016-July 2018) and followed-up for 6 months. We collected data on sociodemographic, environmental exposure, clinical and laboratory characteristics. Diagnosis was established based on viral RNA identification in serum and urine samples using RT-PCR for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue. We describe the baseline sociodemographic and environmental exposure characteristics of participants according to diagnosis, and the frequency of these infections over a two-year period immediately after Zika introduction in Mexico. Results We enrolled 427 participants. Most patients (n = 307, 65.7%) had an acute illness episode with no identified pathogen (UIE), 37 (8%) Zika, 82 (17.6%) dengue, and 1 (0.2%) chikungunya. In 2016 Zika predominated, declined in 2017 and disappeared in 2018; while dengue increased after 2017. Patients with dengue were more likely to be men, younger, and with lower education than those with Zika and UIE. They also reported closer contact with water sources, and with other people diagnosed with dengue. Participants with Zika reported sexual exposure more frequently than people with dengue and UIE. Zika was more likely to be identified in urine while dengue was more likely found in blood in the first seven days of symptoms; but PCR results for both were similar at day 7-14 after symptom onset. Conclusions During the first 2 years of Zika introduction to this dengue hyper-endemic region, frequency of Zika peaked and fell over a two-year period; while dengue progressively increased with a predominance in 2018.

Here, using nanopore technology, we obtained 23 novel partial and near-complete ZIKV genomes from the state of Goias, located in the Midwest of Brazil. Genomic, phylogenetic, and epidemiological approaches were used to retrospectively explore the spatiotemporal evolution of the ZIKV-Asian genotype in this region. As a likely consequence of a gradual accumulation of herd immunity, epidemiological data revealed a decline in the number of reported cases over 2018 to 2021. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that multiple independent introductions of the Asian lineage have occurred in Goias over time and revealed a complex transmission dynamic between epidemic seasons. Together, our results highlight the utility of genomic, epidemiological, and evolutionary methods to understand mosquito-borne epidemics.IMPORTANCE Despite the considerable morbidity and mortality of arboviral infections in Brazil, such as Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and yellow fever, our understanding of these outbreaks is hampered by the limited availability of genomic data to track and control the epidemic. In this study, we provide a retrospective reconstruction of the Zika virus transmission dynamics in the state of Goias by analyzing genomic data from areas in Midwest Brazil not covered by other previous studies. Our study provides an understanding of how ZIKV initiates transmission in this region and reveals a complex transmission dynamic between epidemic seasons.

Zika virus infection in pregnant women and their children: A review,"Marbán-Castro, E; Goncé, A; Fumadó, V; Romero-Acevedo, L; Bardají, A","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV can be transmitted to humans by non-vector borne mechanisms such as sexual intercourse, maternal-foetal transmission or blood transfusion. In 2015, ZIKV emerged in the Americas, and spread to 87 countries and territories with autochthonous transmission, distributed across four of the six WHO regions. Most ZIKV infections in pregnancy are asymptomatic, but mother to child transmission of the virus can occur in 20 to 30% of cases and cause severe foetal and child defects. Children exposed to ZIKV while in utero might develop a pattern of structural anomalies and functional disabilities secondary to central nervous system damage, known as congenital Zika syndrome, and whose most common clinical feature is microcephaly. Normocephalic children born to mothers with ZIKV infection in pregnancy, and with no observable Zika-associated birth defects, may also present with later neurodevelopmental delay or post-natal microcephaly. Screening and detection of ZIKV infection in pregnancy is essential, because most women with ZIKV infection are asymptomatic and clinical manifestations are non-specific. However, the diagnosis of ZIKV infection poses multiple challenges due to limited resources and scarce laboratory capabilities in most affected areas, the narrow window of time that the virus persists in the bloodstream, the large proportion of asymptomatic infections, and the cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses such as Dengue virus (DENV). Molecular methods (RT-PCR) are the most reliable tool to confirm ZIKV infection, as serodiagnosis requires confirmation with neutralization tests in case of inconclusive or positive serology results. Prenatal ultrasound assessment is essential for monitoring foetal development and early detection of possible severe anomalies. A mid-and long-term follow-up of children exposed to ZIKV while in utero is necessary to promptly detect clinical manifestations of possible neurological impairment. Tweetable abstract: Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of pregnancy loss and disability in children. Protection against mosquito bites, access to sexual and reproductive health services, prompt screening and detection of ZIKV infection in pregnancy, and prenatal ultrasound monitoring are key control strategies whilst a vaccine is not available.

"Zika circulation, congenital syndrome, and current guidelines: making sense of it all for the traveller","Chen, LH; Wilson, ME","Purpose of review Zika virus (ZIKV) swept through the Americas and led to recognition of its neurotropism. Zika circulation elsewhere in the world, nonvector transmission including maternal-fetal/sexual/transfusion routes, and additional reports on congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have been published. Recent findings In 2018-2019, ZIKV transmission occurred in Cuba, India, and is suspected to appear sporadically in other countries. Maternal-fetal ZIKV transmission appears to occur in about 26% of ZIKV-infected pregnant women. The US ZIKV Pregnancy and Infant Registry identified 6% of live births to have at least one ZIKV-associated birth defect; 9% had at least one neurodevelopmental abnormality; 1% had both. Infectious virus was rarely isolated from semen of ZIKV-infected male patients beyond day 38 after symptom onset. Brazilian blood donations had low ZIKV prevalence in 2015-2016; in the United States, screening donations was cost-effective only in the high mosquito season in Puerto Rico. ZIKV transmission continues; many countries with competent mosquitoes are at risk. Transmission can occur without detection where surveillance is poor and laboratory capacity limited. Travelers are important sentinels. Variations exist among ZIKV strains and Aedes mosquitoes that influence competence for transmission. Maternal-fetal transmission results in significant rates of abnormality.

After screening by abstract and title, 59 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of these, 35 were excluded (with reasons) and 24 were finally included for qualitative analysis. A total of 51 reported deaths associated with ZIKV infection in nine countries were identified. The majority of cases (56.9%) were not related to Guillain-Barre syndrome. Cases from three countries accounted for 67.6% of the deaths. ZIKV infection was laboratory-confirmed in the majority of cases (64.7%).Discussion: ZIKV was not considered to be a dangerous, and much less a lethal pathogen, until very recently. However, an increasing number of fatalities have been published in the literature since the first death was reported in 2016.

This study aimed to identify and compare the 2015-2016 spatial diffusion pattern of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue epidemics in Salvador-Bahia. Methods: We used two study designs comprising a cross-sectional-to-point pattern and an ecological analysis of lattice data. Residential addresses involving notified cases were geocoded. We used four spatial diffusion analysis techniques: (i) visual inspection of the sequential kernel and choropleth map. (ii) spatial correlogram analysis, (iii) spatial local autocorrelation (LISA) changes analysis and, (iv) nearest neighbor index (NNI) modeling. Results: Kernel and choropleth maps indicated that arboviruses spread to neighboring areas near the first reported cases and occupied these new areas, suggesting a diffusion expansion pattern. A greater case density occurred in central and western areas. In 2015 and 2016, the NNI best-fit model had an S-curve compatible with an expansion pattern for Zika (R-2 = 0.94; 0.95), Chikungunya (R-2 = 0.99; 0.98) and Dengue (R-2 = 0.93; 0.99) epidemics, respectively. Spatial correlograms indicated a decline in spatial lag autocorrelations for the three diseases (expansion pattern). Significant LISA changes suggested different diffusion patterns, although a small number of changes were detected. Conclusions: These findings indicate diffusion expansion, a unique spatial diffusion pattern of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue epidemics in Salvador-Bahia, namely.

"Reporting of birth defects from the Zika outbreak in Colombia, 2015-2017","Duarte, FOM; García, AR; Bedoya, MR; Rángel, GS","Objective. The Zika outbreak affected several tropical countries in 2015 and 2016, requiring the creation of intensified surveillance strategies for microcephaly and other neurological syndromes. The effect of the Zika outbreak on the reporting of birth defects in Colombia was evaluated from the perspective of the national surveillance system.Methods. National reporting of newborns with different birth defects was analyzed; variations in reporting attributed to the epidemic were determined through difference in differences (DID), a semiparametric model.Results. During the period of study, 18,234 cases of birth defects were reported in Colombia. The majority were congenital malformations (91.9%), and 82.3% was confirmed by clinical diagnosis or epidemiological link. In the case of microcephaly, eight new cases per epidemiological week were reported (coefficient of case reporting [D] = 8.8; P = 0.000) and 32 cases from other congenital anatomical malformations (D = 32.0; P= 0.000). The absolute value of the difference in differences estimator attributed to the Zika outbreak increased weekly case reporting of microcephaly (DID = vertical bar-5.0 vertical bar; P= 0.008) and congenital malformations (DID = vertical bar-12.0 vertical bar; P= 0.111).Conclusions. The Zika outbreak increased reporting of newborns with microcephaly, but caused no significant variation in reporting of other malformations and functional birth defects of sensory or metabolic origin in the surveillance system.",2019,,REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,43,,,WOS:000515372800003,10.26633/RPSP.2019.38,,#5838,Duarte 2019,Exclusion reason: not in English; ,
Diagnostic accuracy of prenatal imaging for the diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"Herrera, TT; Cubilla-Batista, I; Goodridge, A; Pereira, TV","Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of prenatal imaging for the diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome. Data sources: Medline (via Pubmed), PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from inception to March 2022. Two researchers independently screened study titles and abstracts for eligibility. Study eligibility criteria: Observational studies with Zika virus-infected pregnant women were included. The index tests included ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging. The reference standard included (1) Zika infection-related perinatal death, stillbirth, and neonatal death within the first 48 h of birth, (2) neonatal intensive care unit admission, and (3) clinically defined adverse perinatal outcomes. Synthesis methods: We extracted 2 x 2 contingency tables. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated using the random-effects bivariate model and assessed the summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS 2 tool. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated with grading of recommendations. Results: We screened 1,459 references and included 18 studies (2359 pregnant women, 347 fetuses with confirmed Zika virus infection). Twelve studies (67%) were prospective cohorts/case series, and six (37%) were retrospective cohort/case series investigations. Fourteen studies (78%) were performed in endemic regions. Ten studies (56%) used prenatal ultrasound only, six (33%) employed ultrasound and fetal MRI, and two studies (11%) used prenatal ultrasound and postnatal fetal MRI. A total of six studies (ultrasound only) encompassing 780 pregnant women (122 fetuses with confirmed Zika virus infection) reported relevant data for meta-analysis (gestation age at which ultrasound imagining was captured ranged from 16 to 34 weeks). There was large heterogeneity across studies regarding sensitivity (range: 12 to 100%) and specificity (range: 50 to 100%). Under a random-effects model, the summary sensitivity of ultrasound was 82% (95% CI, 19 to 99%), and the summary specificity was 97% (71 to 100%). The area under the ROC curve was 97% (95% CI, 72 to 100%), and the summary diagnostic odds ratio was 140 (95% CI, 3 to 7564, P < 0.001). The overall certainty of the evidence was ""very low "". Conclusion: Ultrasound may be useful in improving the diagnostic accuracy of Zika virus infection in pregnancy. However, the evidence is still substantially uncertain due to the methodological limitations of the available studies.

Gist of Zika Virus pathogenesis,"Bhardwaj, U; Pandey, N; Rastogi, M; Singh, SK","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne neurotropic flavivirus. ZIKV infection may lead to microcephaly in developing fetus and Guillain-Barre ' Syndrome (GBS) like symptoms in adults. ZIKV was first reported in humans in 1952 from Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Later, ZIKV outbreak was reported in 2007 from the Yap Island. ZIKV re-emerged as major outbreak in the year 2013 from French Polynesia followed by second outbreak in the year 2015 from Brazil. ZIKV crosses the blood-tissue barriers to enter immune-privileged organs. Clinical manifestations in ZIKV disease includes rash, fever, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, headache, transverse myelitis, meningoencephalitis, Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM).

Peculiarities of Zika Immunity and Vaccine Development: Lessons from Dengue and the Contribution from Controlled Human Infection Model,"Santiago, HC; Pereira-Neto, TA; Gonçalves-Pereira, MH; Terzian, ACB; Durbin, AP","The Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated from a rhesus macaque in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. Isolated cases were reported until 2007, when the first major outbreaks of Zika infection were reported from the Island of Yap in Micronesia and from French Polynesia in 2013. In 2015, ZIKV started to circulate in Latin America, and in 2016, ZIKV was considered by WHO to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to cases of Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), a ZIKV-associated complication never observed before. After a peak of cases in 2016, the infection incidence dropped dramatically but still causes concern because of the associated microcephaly cases, especially in regions where the dengue virus (DENV) is endemic and co-circulates with ZIKV. A vaccine could be an important tool to mitigate CZS in endemic countries. However, the immunological relationship between ZIKV and other flaviviruses, especially DENV, and the low numbers of ZIKV infections are potential challenges for developing and testing a vaccine against ZIKV. Here, we discuss ZIKV vaccine development with the perspective of the immunological concerns implicated by DENV-ZIKV cross-reactivity and the use of a controlled human infection model (CHIM) as a tool to accelerate vaccine development.",2022,,PATHOGENS,11,3,,WOS:000774353100001,10.3390/pathogens11030294,,#5858,Santiago 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-05-30 19:18:51)(Screen): outbreak?; ,
"A review on Zika virus outbreak, epidemiology, transmission and infection dynamics","Kazmi, SS; Ali, W; Bibi, N; Nouroz, F","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a newly emergent relative of the Flaviviridae family and linked to dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIVKV). ZIKV is one of the rising pathogens promptly surpassing geographical borders. ZIKV infection was characterized by mild disease with fever, headache, rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis, with exceptional reports of an association with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly. However, since the end of 2015, an increase in the number of GBS associated cases and an astonishing number of microcephaly in fetus and new-borns in Brazil have been related to ZIKV infection, raising serious worldwide public health concerns. ZIKV is transmitted by the bite of infected female mosquitoes of Aedes species. Clarifying such worrisome relationships is, thus, a current unavoidable goal.

Zika Virus from the Perspective of Observational Studies: a Review,"Saleem, T; Akhtar, H; Jamal, SB; Maryam, F; Faheem, M","Background: Since 1952 when Zika Virus (ZIKV): a Flavivirus, was first discovered in humans, it has not received enough scientific research compared to some of the other members of the family Flaviviridae; like Dengue Virus (DENV). However, this has not stopped the virus from infecting the human population globally. In particular, the global spread of ZIKV has led to a surge in observational studies. Methods: Regarding recently published ZIKV-related literature, we are not aware of any reviews strictly focusing on ZIKV from the perspective of observational studies. Therefore, we reviewed recently published observational studies exploring the global spread of ZIKV and its association with Congenital ZIKV Infection (CZI) and clinical manifesta-tions in adults. Online databases including google scholar, PubMed and Elsevier were used for retrieving relevant studies.Results: ZIKV cases have been reported in different parts of the world, with certain regions reporting more cases than the rest, like Brazil. ZIKV causes a wide spectrum of diseases and disorders including microcephaly, developmental disorders, and Guillain-Barre syndrome to name a few. Furthermore, CZI in neonates mainly manifests into neurologi-cal disorders and diseases, whereas ZIKV in adults' targets various organs.Conclusion: ZIKV poses a serious threat to human population and observational studies provide a different perspective on the damaging capabilities of ZIKV in real-life settings. Moreover, there are gaps in the literature regarding ZIKV-related-complications that future experimental studies need to address. These complications include in-utero transmis-sion, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cross-reactivity, sexual transmission, along with its persistence in the male reproductive tract.",2022,,JOURNAL OF ARTHROPOD-BORNE DISEASES,16,4,262-277,WOS:000954470800001,,,#5883,Saleem 2022,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
"Primary care in the context of the Zika epidemic and congenital Zika syndrome in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil: context, bond and care","Coêlho, BP; Miranda, GMD; da Silva, MCNA; Torres, TCD; Oliveira, TF","The Zika epidemic brought to the fore the birth of children with unknown and unex-pected needs that demand longitudinal follow-up, strengthening the bond, comprehensiveness and coordination of care in health, which are essential attributes of primar y health care (PHC). This ar-ticle aims to evaluate the orientation of PHC care, using the PCATool-Brasil. The data were collected between 2016 and 2019, by means of interviews with parents of children who were born in a public maternity hospital in Recife (state of Pernambu-co) between October 2015 and February 2016, a critical period of the microcephaly outbreak, es-pecially in the Northeast of Brazil. The parents of 109 children participated in the survey, 15.6% of which had a confirmed microcephaly diagnosis. The degree of affiliation and access was sufficient, but the aspects of coordination of care, longitu-dinality, comprehensiveness, family and commu-nity orientation were insufficient. In the context of congenital Zika syndrome, these attributes are essential for the care of children and families.

In ZIKV-exposed children without CZS, it is often unclear whether they were protected from in utero infection and neurotropism. Early neurodevelopmental assessment is essential for detecting neurodevelopmental delays (NDDs) and prioritizing at-risk children for early intervention. We compared neurodevelopmental outcomes between ZIKV-exposed and unexposed children at 1, 3 and 4 years to assess exposure-associated NDD risk. A total of 384 mother-child dyads were enrolled during a period of active ZIKV transmission (2016-2017) in Grenada, West Indies. Exposure status was based on laboratory assessment of prenatal and postnatal maternal serum. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Oxford Neurodevelopment Assessment, the NEPSY & REG; Second Edition and Cardiff Vision Tests, at 12 (n = 66), 36 (n = 58) and 48 (n = 59) months, respectively.

"Reviewing estimates of the basic reproduction number for dengue, Zika and chikungunya across global climate zones","Liu, Y; Lillepold, K; Semenza, JC; Tozan, Y; Quam, MBM; Rocklöv, J","Background: Globally, dengue, Zika virus, and chikungunya are important viral mosquito-borne diseases that infect millions of people annually. Their geographic range includes not only tropical areas but also sub-tropical and temperate zones such as Japan and Italy. The relative severity of these arboviral disease outbreaks can vary depending on the setting. In this study we explore variation in the epidemiologic potential of outbreaks amongst these climatic zones and arboviruses in order to elucidate potential reasons behind such differences.Methodology: We reviewed the peer-reviewed literature (PubMed) to obtain basic reproduction number (R-0) estimates for dengue, Zika virus, and chikungunya from tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions. We also computed R-0 estimates for temperate and sub-tropical climate zones, based on the outbreak curves in the initial outbreak phase. Lastly we compared these estimates across climate zones, defined by latitude.Results: Of 2115 studies, we reviewed the full text of 128 studies and included 65 studies in our analysis. Our results suggest that the R-0 of an arboviral outbreak depends on climate zone, with lower R-0 estimates, on average, in temperate zones (R-0 = 2.03) compared to tropical (R-0 = 3.44) and sub-tropical zones (R-0 = 10.29). The variation in R-0 was considerable, ranging from 0.16 to 65. The largest R-0 was for dengue (65) and was estimated by the Ross-Macdonald model in the tropical zone, whereas the smallest R-0 (0.16) was for Zika virus and was estimated statistically from an outbreak curve in the sub-tropical zone.Conclusions: The results indicate climate zone to be an important determinant of the basic reproduction number, R-0, for dengue, Zika virus, and chikungunya. The role of other factors as determinants of R-0, such as methods, environmental and social conditions, and disease control, should be further investigated. The results suggest that It o may increase in temperate regions in response to global warming, and highlight the increasing need for strengthening preparedness and control activities.",2020,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,182,,,WOS:000516094400103,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109114,,#5909,Liu 2020,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Mathematical modeling on co-infection: transmission dynamics of Zika virus and Dengue fever,"Jose, SA; Raja, R; Omede, BI; Agarwal, RP; Alzabut, J; Cao, J; Balas, VE","In this paper, a deterministic mathematical model for Dengue Fever (DF) and Zika virus (ZIKV) co-infection transmission dynamics is formulated and analyzed. Two sub-models, namely ZIKV-only and DF-only sub-models, are considered first of all. Rigorous qualitative analysis of the sub-models reveals that each of the diseases undergoes the phenomenon of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number of both ZIKV-only and DF-only submodels (denoted by R-0z(+) and R-0d respectively) is less than unity. It is shown, using the centre manifold theory that the full ZIKV-DF co-infection model undergoes a backward bifurcation phenomenon.

Zika autoimmunity and Guillain-Barre syndrome,"Katz, I; Gilburd, B; Shovman, O","Purpose of review To summarize the recent data regarding Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) as an autoimmune disorder following infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, including the proposed pathogenic mechanisms and the role of autoantibodies. Recent findings The loss of self-tolerance that leads to autoimmune diseases is a multifactorial process that may be illustrated as 'the mosaic of autoimmunity'. Infectious agents may contribute to the development of autoimmunity by several proposed mechanisms. One of the central mechanisms is molecular mimicry, which is also the most plausible mechanism in the case of ZIKV-induced autoimmune disorders. A recent meta-analysis found a low prevalence of GBS associated with ZIKV infection. Nevertheless, the estimated cost of illness for patients with GBS associated with ZIKV are tremendous and exceed 4.7 million dollars per year in Brazil alone. Currently, there is sufficient data to indicate that ZIKV infection is one of many triggers and factors that may contribute to the development GBS. Thus, it is advised to evaluate and determine ZIKV exposure and infection in the management of potential GBS patients.",2019,,CURRENT OPINION IN RHEUMATOLOGY,31,5,484-487,WOS:000501148600010,10.1097/BOR.0000000000000629,,#5914,Katz 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

It was postulated that high dengue virus antibody levels found at the population-level in endemic countries might have contributed to the occurrence of the regional pandemic of Zika disease. A case series of suspected cases of congenital Zika syndrome in a maternity hospital in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico was assembled to assess why they were not reported and to explore the hypothesis of dengue virus antibodydependent enhancement of Zika disease. Methods: We used a quantitative approach to describe clinical and imaging records and used data from interviews of a total of 13 suspected cases of congenital Zika syndrome. We also quantitated dengue 1 and 2 antibodies using an 80% plaque reduction neutralization test of sera specimens obtained from the mothers of these 13 cases and compared them to those of a group of mothers who delivered normal newborns in the same hospital. Results: Only one of the suspected cases was laboratory-confirmed because appropriate specimens were not collected from the newborns as required by the case definition. We found 1) microcephaly, 2) hypoplasia/hypogeneses, thinning or absence of brain structures, 3) multiple birth defects, 4) calcifications, and cysts, 5) meningocele/encephalocele, and 6) hydrocephalus in 100 %, 76.9 %, 38.5 %, 38.5 %, 30.8 %, and 23.1 %, respectively of the case series. The cases clustered geographically, and 77 % occurred between May 2016 to March 2017 and recalled or were told by a doctor they had Zika fever. There was a four-fold increased risk of congenital Zika syndrome among those with dengue 1 antibody as compared to those with dengue 2 antibodies (odds ratio = 3.6; 95 % confidence interval: 0.7, 20.5), reaching only borderline statistical significance. Conclusions: We found in the largest maternal facility of the capital of the State of Chiapas, in Mexico, that only 7.7 % of suspected cases were confirmed, and that the rather complex requirement of cerebrospinal fluid specimens or serological specimens of newborns for suspected cases of congenital Zika syndrome used during the pandemic resulted in low sensitivity of the surveillance system. The finding of higher levels of dengue 1 than dengue 2 antibodies in cases than the referent population, requires further evaluation and may suggest a role for dengue antibody-dependent response in Zika disease.",2022,,POBLACION Y SALUD EN MESOAMERICA,20,1,,WOS:000824710200005,10.15517/psm.v20i1.48339,,#5937,Ayala 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Use of Twitter data to improve Zika virus surveillance in the United States during the 2016 epidemic,"Masri, S; Jia, JF; Li, C; Zhou, GF; Lee, MC; Yan, GY; Wu, J","BackgroundZika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne arbovirus that can produce serious public health consequences. In 2016, ZIKV caused an epidemic in many countries around the world, including the United States. ZIKV surveillance and vector control is essential to combating future epidemics. However, challenges relating to the timely publication of case reports significantly limit the effectiveness of current surveillance methods. In many countries with poor infrastructure, established systems for case reporting often do not exist. Previous studies investigating the H1N1 pandemic, general influenza and the recent Ebola outbreak have demonstrated that time- and geo-tagged Twitter data, which is immediately available, can be utilized to overcome these limitations.MethodsIn this study, we employed a recently developed system called Cloudberry to filter a random sample of Twitter data to investigate the feasibility of using such data for ZIKV epidemic tracking on a national and state (Florida) level. Two auto-regressive models were calibrated using weekly ZIKV case counts and zika tweets in order to estimate weekly ZIKV cases 1 week in advance.ResultsWhile models tended to over-predict at low case counts and under-predict at extreme high counts, a comparison of predicted versus observed weekly ZIKV case counts following model calibration demonstrated overall reasonable predictive accuracy, with an R-2 of 0.74 for the Florida model and 0.70 for the U.S. model. Time-series analysis of predicted and observed ZIKV cases following internal cross-validation exhibited very similar patterns, demonstrating reasonable model performance. Spatially, the distribution of cumulative ZIKV case counts (local- & travel-related) and zika tweets across all 50U.S. states showed a high correlation (r=0.73) after adjusting for population.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the value of utilizing Twitter data for the purposes of disease surveillance.

Understanding social inequalities in Zika infection and its consequences: A model of pathways and policy entry-points,"Diderichsen, F; Augusto, LGD; Perez, B","The health consequences of arbovirus infections such as dengue fever (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) has in recent years become a public health challenge, due to failure of prevention followed by increased incidence and pronounced social inequality in occurrence and consequences. This motivates a more systematic analysis of the potential mechanisms and pathways that generate these inequalities. We present in the paper a model that delineates five possible mechanisms driving the inequality of ZIKV and congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). They include differential exposure to bad housing and sanitary conditions, differential exposure to vector density and virus, differential vulnerability to the health effects of exposure to virus, differential intrauterine susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of ZIKV infection and differential social consequences of caring for a disabled child. For each mechanism, we present empirical evidence or need for more research as well as a discussion about policy implications.",2019,,GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH,14,5,675-683,WOS:000461065000006,10.1080/17441692.2018.1532528,,#5939,Diderichsen 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Using data from the Zika Brazilian Cohorts Consortium, this study aims, to estimate the risk of adverse outcomes among offspring of women with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy and to explore heterogeneity between studies. Methods We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis of the offspring of 1548 pregnant women from 13 studies, using one and two-stage meta-analyses to estimate the absolute risks. Findings Of the 1548 ZIKV-exposed pregnancies, the risk of miscarriage was 0.9%, while the risk of stillbirth was 0.3%. Among the pregnancies with liveborn children, the risk of prematurity was 10,5%, the risk of low birth weight was 7.7, and the risk of small for gestational age (SGA) was 16.2%. For other abnormalities, the absolute risks were: 2.6% for microcephaly at birth or first evaluation, 4.0% for microcephaly at any time during follow-up, 7.9% for neuroimaging abnormalities, 18.7% for functional neurological abnormalities, 4.0% for ophthalmic abnormalities, 6.4% for auditory abnormalities, 0.6% for arthrogryposis, and 1.5% for dysphagia. This risk was similar in all sites studied and in different socioeconomic conditions, indicating that there are not likely to be other factors modifying this association. Interpretation This study based on prospectively collected data generates the most robust evidence to date on the risks of congenital ZIKV infections over the early life course. Overall, approximately one-third of liveborn children with prenatal ZIKV exposure presented with at least one abnormality compatible with congenital infection, while the risk to present with at least two abnormalities in combination was less than 1.0%.",2023,,LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS,17,,,WOS:001029991800001,10.1016/j.lana.2022.100395,,#5953,ZikaBrazilianCohortsConsortiu 2023,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez (2024-12-03 03:10:30)(Included): Meta-analysis of indiv-level data from 13 studies (one and two-stage meta-analyses); Extractor (2024-08-21 23:44:31)(Select): miscarriage risk and other risk factors; ,

As acute infection can be asymptomatic in up to 73% of cases, infants with microcephaly represent a diagnostic challenge for pediatricians. We describe the frequency of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in Brazilian children born to asymptomatic pregnant mothers and its differential diagnosis.Methods: This longitudinal, observational study was conducted on children with suspected CZS whose mothers did not report rash during pregnancy, referred to the reference hospital in a metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The diagnosis of suspected CZS was based on Brazilian Ministry of Health protocol.Results: Forty-three (17%) of 246 referred children were born to mothers without rash history during pregnancy. Thirteen (30%) of 43 children met the Brazilian Ministry of Health criteria for CZS, all with microcephaly (two post-natal). The other children included 11 cases with post-natal microcephaly due to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (6), non-progressive encephalopathy of unknown etiology (2), microcephaly under investigation (2) and congenital toxoplasmosis (1); 17 children were misdiagnosed with microcephaly and progressed with normal head circumference during the follow-up period; one child was included because of epidemiological link and one was loss to follow-up. All children who underwent laboratory investigation for ZIKV infection during neonatal period had negative RT-qPCR tests.Conclusion: We emphasize the increasing importance of CZS in differential diagnosis of microcephaly at birth or post-natal period.

Zika Virus and Arthritis/Arthralgia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Wimalasiri-Yapa, BMCR; Yapa, HE; Huang, XD; Hafner, LM; Kenna, TJ; Frentiu, FD","Dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses share similar disease features, rendering them difficult to distinguish clinically. Incapacitating arthralgia/arthritis is a specific manifestation associated with chikungunya virus infection. However, the profile of arthralgia/arthritis in Zika virus (ZIKV) cases has not been well characterized. Articles were extracted from PubMed and Scopus databases reporting original data from patients with arthralgia/arthritis, according to the Cochrane Collaboration. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, 137 articles reporting ZIKV-associated joint symptoms were reviewed. Arthralgia was more frequently reported (n = 124 from case studies, n = 1779 from population-based studies) than arthritis (n = 7 and n = 121, respectively). Arthralgia was resolved in <1 week in 54%, and within 1-2 weeks in 40% of cases. The meta-analysis of cases in population-based studies identified a pooled prevalence of 53.55% for arthralgia. The pooled prevalence of arthralgia/arthritis during outbreaks depended on the geographic location, with a higher joint symptom burden observed in the Americas compared to South East Asia (Brazil: 60.79%; Puerto Rico: 68.89% and South East Asia: 26.46%). We conclude that non-specific constitutional arthralgia is the most common joint manifestation during ZIKV infection, being present in nearly half of cases but resolving by two weeks in >90% of these.

Modelling the impact of antibody-dependent enhancement on disease severity of Zika virus and dengue virus sequential and co-infection,"RADAM LAC Res Team; Tang, BA; Xiao, YN; Sander, B; Kulkarni, MA; Wu, JH","Human infections with viruses of the genus Flavivirus, including dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), are of increasing global importance. Owing to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), secondary infection with one Flavivirus following primary infection with another Flavivirus can result in a significantly larger peak viral load with a much higher risk of severe disease. Although several mathematical models have been developed to quantify the virus dynamics in the primary and secondary infections of DENV, little progress has been made regarding secondary infection of DENV after a primary infection of ZIKV, or DENV-ZIKV co-infection. Here, we address this critical gap by developing compartmental models of virus dynamics. We first fitted the models to published data on dengue viral loads of the primary and secondary infections with the observation that the primary infection reaches its peak much more gradually than the secondary infection. We then quantitatively show that ADE is the key factor determining a sharp increase/decrease of viral load near the peak time in the secondary infection. In comparison, our simulations of DENV and ZIKV co-infection (simultaneous rather than sequential) show that ADE has very limited influence on the peak DENV viral load. This indicates pre-existing immunity to ZIKV is the determinant of a high level of ADE effect. Our numerical simulations show that (i) in the absence of ADE effect, a subsequent co-infection is beneficial to the second virus; and (ii) if ADE is feasible, then a subsequent co-infection can induce greater damage to the host with a higher peak viral load and a much earlier peak time for the second virus, and for the second peak for the first virus.",2020,,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,7,4,,WOS:000527775000004,10.1098/rsos.191749,,#5980,RADAMLACResTeam 2020,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; Extractor (2024-05-20 21:14:49)(Select): co-infection study; ,

Data on survival among children with congenital Zika syndrome are limited. Methods In this population-based cohort study, we used linked, routinely collected data in Brazil, from January 2015 through December 2018, to estimate mortality among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome as compared with those without the syndrome. Kaplan-Meier curves and survival models were assessed with adjustment for confounding and with stratification according to gestational age, birth weight, and status of being small for gestational age. Results A total of 11,481,215 live-born children were followed to 36 months of age. The mortality rate was 52.6 deaths (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.6 to 58.0) per 1000 person-years among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome, as compared with 5.6 deaths (95% CI, 5.6 to 5.7) per 1000 person-years among those without the syndrome. The mortality rate ratio among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome, as compared with those without the syndrome, was 11.3 (95% CI, 10.2 to 12.4). Among infants born before 32 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight of less than 1500 g, the risks of death were similar regardless of congenital Zika syndrome status. Among infants born at term, those with congenital Zika syndrome were 14.3 times (95% CI, 12.4 to 16.4) as likely to die as those without the syndrome (mortality rate, 38.4 vs. 2.7 deaths per 1000 person-years). Among infants with a birth weight of 2500 g or greater, those with congenital Zika syndrome were 12.9 times (95% CI, 10.9 to 15.3) as likely to die as those without the syndrome (mortality rate, 32.6 vs. 2.5 deaths per 1000 person-years). The burden of congenital anomalies, diseases of the nervous system, and infectious diseases as recorded causes of deaths was higher among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome than among those without the syndrome.

Prevalence of Zika virus in blood donations: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Liu, RF; Wang, XZ; Ma, Y; Wu, JY; Mao, C; Yuan, LH; Lu, JH","BackgroundTransfusion-Transmitted Zika virus (TT-ZIKV) has become an emerging threat to world blood banks due to the fast spread of ZIKV epidemics and high rate of asymptomatic infections. For the risk assessment of ZIKV infection in blood products, relevant studies in blood donations or blood donors tested for ZIKV were collected and analyzed systematically. The overall prevalence of ZIKV infection were estimated through meta-analysis and potential risk factors were detected. The results will provide important clues for the protocol design of blood screening tests.MethodsRelevant articles about the rate of ZIKV detected in blood samples were identified from PubMed, Scopus and Web Of Science using key terms search strategy until October 7, 2017. Eligible articles were screened following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were performed by software R3.4.1. Overall postdonation and posttransfusion follow-ups were analyzed.ResultsTen literatures (528,947 blood samples) were included for meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of ZIKV (RNA and antibody) in blood donations was 1.02% (95%CI 0.36-1.99). The pooled prevalence of ZIKV RNA in blood donations was 0.85% (95%CI 0.21-1.88) less than the pooled prevalence of anti-ZIKV antibodies 1.61% (95%CI 0.03-5.21), however the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.52). The prevalence varied significantly in different geographical regions (p<0.001). Blood donations were more than two times likely to be infected by ZIKV in Zika epidemic period (1.37, 95%CI 0.91-1.91) than in non-epidemic period (0.61, 95%CI 0-2.55). The prevalence of anti-ZIKV antibodies (1.61, 95%CI 0.03-5.21) was almost twice as much as ZIKV nucleic acid detected in blood donations (0.85, 95%CI 0.21-1.88). However, statistically significant differences were not observed. A total of 122 ZIKV positive blood donors were followed, of which 48 (39%) reported symptoms postdonation, but none of the 13 followed recipients reported any clinical symptoms related to Zika infection posttransfusion.ConclusionThe pooled prevalence of Zika infection in blood donations was 1.02%. The prevalence varied greatly and reached to high-risk level in most of the situations. The results suggest that nucleic acid tests (NAT) for blood screening and pathogen reduction/inactivation technology (PRT) should be implemented in Zika-endemic areas and appropriate strategies should be designed according to different conditions.

PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, SciELO, and LILACS were searched until June 23, 2020. Observational studies that evaluated the frequency of epilepsy in children diagnosed with CZS according to international criteria were included in the study.Results Fourteen studies evaluating 903 patients diagnosed with CZS were pooled in a meta-analysis. All studies were conducted in Brazil, with reports published between 2016 and 2020, and included children diagnosed with CSZ from 0 to 40 months of age. The overall rate of epilepsy in children diagnosed with CZS was estimated at 60% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.68). The studies included in this review show that the frequency of epilepsy in patients with CSZ varies with age, with higher rates in older children. Epileptic spasms was the primary type of seizure observed in this group, followed by focal and generalized crisis. The response rate to anti-epileptic drugs was considerably low, ranging from 20% of seizure control in the first year and 30% in the second year.Significance Children with CZS presented a high cumulative incidence of epilepsy episodes with increased severity and a low response to anti-epileptic therapy, which is associated with the extensive damage caused by the Zika virus on the cortical structures of patients.",2021,,EPILEPSIA,62,5,1193-1207,WOS:000634156000001,10.1111/epi.16890,,#6008,Maia 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

Following the Zika epidemic onset in Latin America, the incidence of congenital anomalies increased in Brazil. This study aimed to determine the frequency of congenital anomalies in one Brazilian state and assess potential factors associated with them. Methods This cross-sectional descriptive study was based on data concerning congenital anomalies recorded in the Brazilian Live-Born Information System during the Zika epidemic in Mato Grosso do Sul state from 2015 to 2018. Congenital anomalies were stratified according to year of birth and classified using ICD-10 categories. Results In total, 1,473 (0.85%) anomalies were registered. Within the number of cases recorded, microcephaly showed the greatest frequency and variations, with a 420% increase observed in the number of cases from 2015 to 2016. We identified an increase in the incidence of central nervous system anomalies, with the highest peak observed in 2016 followed by a subsequent decrease. Musculoskeletal, nervous, and cardiovascular system anomalies, and eye, ear, face, and neck anomalies represented 73.9% of all recorded anomalies.

Modelling analysis of Zika virus with saturated incidence using optimal control theory,"Goswami, NK","A non-linear mathematical model of the Zika virus is proposed and analysed the impact of optimal control strategies with the saturated incident. The basic reproduction number (R-0) is computed and performed sensitivity analysis to identify the key parameters that influence the basic reproduction number. To investigate the optimal control strategies, three types of time-dependent control parameters are introduced in the system to reduce the transmission. Electronic devices, insecticide-treated bed nets, and mosquito repulsive lotions are used to reduce mosquito biting rates.

The Association of Anti-Ganglioside Antibodies in the Pathogenesis and Development of Zika-Associated Guillain-Barre Syndrome,"Mohite, D; Omole, JA; Bhatti, KS; Kaleru, T; Khan, S","Zika virus ( ZIKV) has created major outbreaks all over the Americas and has caused severe neurological complications. The main neurological complications linked to ZIKV are Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), encephalitis, myelitis, and microcephaly. We thoroughly searched for published literature on PubMed and found evidence supporting the relationship between ZIKV and GBS. Through April 1, 2020, 429 publications were available on PubMed using the words ""Zika associated GBS."" Among these, only four results linked anti-ganglioside antibodies to Zika-associated GBS. So, we expanded our search to other platforms like PubMed Central (R) (PMC), Google Scholar, and Cochrane, after which we shortlisted 28 studies. These studies include review articles, observational studies, case series, and case reports. The information collected from these articles were mainly based on the outbreaks in Latin America and the results that these patients showed in the course of the disease. It took a lag time of 7-10 days for the patients to develop Zika-associated GBS. We used all the evidence regarding the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, neurological complications, and diagnostic criteria that supported the findings of anti-ganglioside antibodies to ZIKV-associated GBS. Patients were detected with the presence of these antibodies in their urine through the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. But the mechanism by which the ZIKV causes other complications like myelitis and encephalitis is still unknown and yet to be explored to develop treatment and management strategies.",2020,,CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE,12,7,,WOS:000545574700007,10.7759/cureus.8983,,#6064,Mohite 2020,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Zika virus and microcephaly in Southeast Asia: A cause for concern?,"Kuadkitkan, A; Wikan, N; Sornjai, W; Smith, DR","Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito transmitted virus in the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, recently emerged to cause infections in more than 70 countries and territories around the world. While human infection is normally asymptomatic, it can also result in a mild febrile disease similar to dengue fever. However, when a pregnant woman is infected, ZIKV can cause fetal abnormalities including microcephaly. Evidence has suggested that ZIKV has circulated in Southeast Asia for more than a decade and yet cases of ZIKV associated microcephaly remain sparsely documented. This review seeks to collate the information currently existing on ZIKV associated microcephaly in Southeast Asia, and assess the potential future risk posed by this virus. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Preparedness of public health-care system for Zika virus outbreak: An Indian perspective,"Gupta, N; Yadav, PD; Patil, DY; Sapkal, G","Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has emerged recently and affected in many countries. Since its discovery in Uganda in 1947, two major outbreaks were reported from Yap Islands in 2007 and French Polynesia in 2013. In 2015, the first case of ZIKV infection was confirmed from Brazil followed by a report of cases from American and Caribbean countries. In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared ZIKV infection a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. India reported the first Zika case in 2017. Subsequently, 157 laboratory-confirmed cases of ZIKV including 63 pregnant women were reported from Rajasthan, India in 2018. Since 2014, many countries took initiatives to boost their public health system to combat ZIKV. However, there is still scope for the improvement. This review describes ZIKV outbreaks, diagnostic challenges, surveillance and control measures in India and the future perspective to deal with the ZIKV outbreak in India. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Congenital Zika syndrome and living conditions in the largest city of northeastern Brazil,"Souza, MPA; Da Natividade, MS; Werneck, GL; Dos Santos, DN","Background The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic hit Brazil in 2015 and resulted in a generation of children at risk of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The social vulnerability of certain segments of the population contributed to the disproportional occurrence of CZS in the Brazilian Northeast, the poorest region in the country. Living conditions are essential factors in understanding the social determination of CZS, which is embedded in a complex interaction between biological, environmental, and social factors. Salvador, the biggest city in the region, played a central role in the context of the epidemic and was a pioneer in reporting the ZIKV infection and registering a high number of cases of CZS. The aim of the study was identifying the incidence and spatial distribution pattern of children with CZS in the municipality of Salvador, according to living conditions. Methods This is an ecological study that uses the reported cases of ZIKV and CZS registered in the epidemiological surveillance database of the Municipal Secretariat of Health of the city of Salvador between August of 2015 and July of 2016. The neighborhoods formed the analysis units and the thematic maps were built based on the reported cases. Associations between CZS and living conditions were assessed using the Kernel ratio and a spatial autoregressive linear regression model. Results Seven hundred twenty-six live births were reported, of which 236 (32.5%) were confirmed for CZS. Despite the reports of ZIKV infection being widely distributed, the cases of CZS were concentrated in poor areas of the city. A positive spatial association was observed between living in places with poorer living conditions and births of children with CZS. Conclusions This study shows the role of living conditions in the occurrence of births of children with CZS and indicates the need for approaches that recognize the part played by social inequalities in determining CZS and in caring for the children affected.",2022,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,22,1,,WOS:000813757700008,10.1186/s12889-022-13614-x,,#6138,Souza 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-21 23:47:21)(Select): risk factors; ,

This study aims to evaluate HC growth in children with CZS in the first three years of life and identify associated factors. HC data obtained at birth and in neuropediatric consultations from 74 children with CZS were collected from the Child's Health Handbook, parents' reports, and medical records. Predictors of HC z-score were investigated using different mixed-effects models; Akaike's information criterion was used for model selection. The HC z-score decreased from -2.7 +/- 1.6 at birth to -5.5 +/- 2.2 at 3 months of age, remaining relatively stable thereafter. In the selected adjusted model, the presence of severe brain parenchymal atrophy and maternal symptoms of infection in the first trimester of pregnancy were associated with a more pronounced reduction in the HC z-score in the first three years of life. The decrease of HC z-score in CZS children over the first three months demonstrated a reduced potential for growth and development of the central nervous system of these children. The prognosis of head growth in the first 3 years of life is worse when maternal infection occurs in the first gestational trimester and in children who have severe brain parenchymal atrophy.",2022,,CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA,38,8,,WOS:000841757600001,10.1590/0102-311XEN296021,,#6143,Takahasi 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-22 00:10:47)(Select): risk factor; ,

Much of our knowledge on health problems and infectious encountered by international travellers has evolved as a result of GeoSentinel surveillance, providing geographic and temporal trends in morbidity among travellers while contributing to improved pre-travel advice. We set out to synthesize epidemiological information, clinical manifestations and time trends for dengue, chikungunya and Zika in travellers as captured by GeoSentinel.Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed on international travellers who presented with dengue, chikungunya or Zika virus infections to GeoSentinel sites around the world from 1995 until 2020.Results: Of 107 GeoSentinel publications, 42 articles were related to dengue, chikungunya and/or Zika. The final analyses and synthesis of and results presented here are based on the findings from 27 original articles covering the three arboviral diseases.Conclusions: Dengue is the most frequent arboviral disease encountered in travellers presenting to GeoSentinel sites, with increasing trends over the past two decades. In Southeast Asia, annual proportionate morbidity increased from 50 dengue cases per 1000 ill returned travellers in non-epidemic years to an average of 159 cases per 1000 travellers during epidemic years. The highest number of travellers with chikungunya virus infections was reported during the chikungunya outbreak in the Americas and the Caribbean in the years 2013-16.

Possible Routes for Zika Virus Vertical Transmission in Human Placenta: A Comprehensive Review,"Villalobos-Sánchez, E; Burciaga-Flores, M; Zapata-Cuellar, L; Camacho-Villegas, TA; Elizondo-Quiroga, DE","Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have gained notoriety due to congenital abnormalities. Pregnant women have a greater risk of ZIKV infection and consequent transmission to their progeny due to the immunological changes associated with pregnancy. ZIKV has been detected in amniotic fluid, as well as in fetal and neonatal tissues of infected pregnant women. However, the mechanism by which ZIKV reaches the fetus is not well understood. The four dengue virus serotypes have been the most widely used flaviviruses to elucidate the host-cell entry pathways. Nevertheless, it is of increasing interest to understand the specific interaction between ZIKV and the host cell, especially in the gestation period. Herein, the authors describe the mechanisms of prenatal vertical infection of ZIKV based on results from in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies, including murine models and nonhuman primates. It also includes up-to-date knowledge from ex vivo and natural infections in pregnant women explaining the vertical transmission along four tracks: transplacental, paracellular, transcytosis mediated by extracellular vesicles, and paraplacental route and the antibody-dependent enhancement process. A global understanding of the diverse pathways used by ZIKV to cross the placental barrier and access the fetus, along with a better comprehension of the pathogenesis of ZIKV in pregnant females, may constitute a fundamental role in the design of antiviral drugs to reduce congenital disabilities associated with ZIKV.",2022,,VIRAL IMMUNOLOGY,35,6,392-403,WOS:000793487900001,10.1089/vim.2021.0199,,#6168,Villalobos-Sánchez 2022,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-03-23 04:44:00)(Screen): review; ,
Zika virus: A current review of literature,"Yildiz, BU; Yanik, K; Yakupoglu, O","Zika virus is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. Its spread has been an ongoing pandemic and the focus of a public health emergency since 2007. Though Zika virus was first detected in 1947, its rapid spread, newfound modes of transmission, and the absence of adequate treatments have recently brought this virus into the public eye. After an outbreak of Zika virus in Brazil in 2007, many complications were suspected to be linked with to its infection. These complications include Guillain-Barre syndrome, several congenital malformations, microcephaly, and some neurological complications. There is no effective treatment nor vaccine for Zika virus. Ongoing research focusses largely on preventing infection in regions where transmission is most common, especially in populations of pregnant women. It is advisable for clinicians working in non-endemic areas to maintain a full awareness of Zika virus in order to properly manage this infection when it spreads into their catchment areas.

Zika virus infection and risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome: A meta-analysis,"Bautista, LE","Objective: Findings from studies of the association between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) are inconsistent. I conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the nature of this association.Methods: I searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scielo, and DOAJ for case report, ecological, and analytic studies with ""Zika"" and ""Guillain-Barre syndrome"" as keywords, published up to July 1stth 2018. I evaluated if ZIKV infection status influenced the diagnosis of GBS (detection bias) in case-report and analytic studies; assessed if changes in weekly number of cases of ZIKV infection during outbreaks were followed by changes in number of GBS cases 1-8 weeks later; gauged the likelihood of selection, confounding, information, sparse data, and time-dependent bias (i.e. when ZIKV infection was ascertained after GBS onset) in analytic studies; and calculated the average ZIKV-GBS odds ratio (OR) in studies without time-dependent bias.Results: In case reports, ZIKV infection prevalence in GBS cases was 2.4 to 25 times higher than expected. Changes in the number of ZIKV-infection cases during outbreaks were not consequentially followed by changes in the number of GBS cases (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.99-1.03). Major biases were likely in all but one analytic study, which showed a non-significant ZIKV-GBS association. The average ZIKV-GBS OR in studies without time-dependent bias was 1.57 (95% CI: 0.86-2.86).Interpretation: These findings indicate the available evidence is insufficient to claim ZIKV infection causes GBS.

Importance of Zika Virus NS5 Protein for Viral Replication,"Elshahawi, H; Hassan, SS; Balasubramaniam, V","Zika virus is the latest addition to an ever-growing list of arboviruses that are causing outbreaks with serious consequences. A few mild cases were recorded between 1960 and 1980 until the first major outbreak in 2007 on Yap Island. This was followed by more severe outbreaks in French Polynesia (2013) and Brazil (2015), which significantly increased both Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly cases. No current vaccines or treatments are available, however, recent studies have taken interest in the NS5 protein which encodes both the viral methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This makes it important for viral replication alongside other important functions such as inhibiting the innate immune system thus ensuring virus survival and replication. Structural studies can help design inhibitors, while biochemical studies can help understand the various mechanisms utilized by NS5 thus counteracting them might inhibit or abolish the viral infection. Drug repurposing targeting the NS5 protein has also proven to be an effective tool since hundreds of thousands of compounds can be screened therefore saving time and resources, moreover information on these compounds might already be available especially if they are used to treat other ailments.",2019,,PATHOGENS,8,4,,WOS:000506652300012,10.3390/pathogens8040169,,#6195,Elshahawi 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-05-30 01:44:19)(Select): primary objective is the structural protein; Extractor (2024-03-13 04:05:48)(Screen): outbreak information?; ,
Maternal infection with Zika virus and prevalence of congenital disorders in infants: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Nithiyanantham, SF; Badawi, A","Objective Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a vector-borne disease that can be transmitted sexually and vertically. The vertical transmission of the virus may lead to congenital Zika syndrome in infants. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published reports documenting the prevalence of congenital Zika-related disorders in infants of mothers infected with ZIKV during pregnancy. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (R) Epub ahead of print, Embase, Embase Classic and Web of Science databases to identify human studies reporting prevalence of congenital disorders in infants of ZIKV-infected mothers. Results We identified 25 reports selected for inclusion in the current study (n = 4683 subjects). The majority of the studies were from South American high-risk countries. Only one third of the identified studies were conducted in the United States. Clinical maternal symptoms included maculopapular rash (76.9%), arthralgia (46.4%), fever (45.5%) and headache (31.8%) with myalgia and conjunctivitis only presented in 25% of the cases. The most prevalent congenital disorder in the newborns was brain calcifications (42.6; 95% CI, 30.8-54.4), followed by ventriculomegaly (21.8; 95% CI, 15.2-28.4), joint abnormalities (13.2; 95% CI, 9.4-18.2), ocular abnormalities (4.2; 95% CI, 1.0-7.5) and microcephaly (3.9; 95% CI, 2.4-5.4).

This study describes the 24-hour Holier findings of infants with confirmed vertical exposure to the ZIKV by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in the mother's blood during pregnancy and/or in the urine or cerebrospinal fluid of the newborn. Data analysis was descriptive and included two subgroups according to the presence of fetal distress, positive PCR to ZIKV in the newborn, CZS and severe microcephaly. Heart rate, pauses, arrhythmias. ST segment and QT interval analyses and HRV evaluation through R-R, SDNN, pNN50 and rMMSD were described. The Mann-Whitney test was performed to assess differences between the two subgroups. The sample consisted of 15 infants with a mean age of 16 months, nine of whom were male. No arrhythmias or QT interval changes were observed.

"High-risk spatial clusters for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Souza-Santos, R; Sobral, A; Périssé, ARS","OBJECTIVE: To analyze the spatial distribution and identify high-risk spatial clusters of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya (ZDC), in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and their socioeconomic status.METHODS: An ecological study based on data from a seroprevalence survey. Using a rapid diagnostic test to detect the arboviruses, 2,114 individuals were tested in 2018. The spatial distribution was analyzed using kernel estimation. To detect high-risk spatial clusters of arboviruses, we used multivariate scan statistics. The Social Development Index (SDI) was considered in the analysis of socioeconomic status.RESULTS: Among the 2,114 individuals, 1,714 (81.1%) were positive for at least one arbovirus investigated. The kernel estimation showed positive individuals for at least one arbovirus in all regions of the city, with hot spots in the North, coincident with regions with very low or low SDI. The scan statistic detected three significant (p<0.05) high-risk spatial clusters for Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses. These clusters correspond to 35.7% (n=613) of all positive individuals of the sample. The most likely cluster was in the North (cluster 1) and overlapped regions with very low and low SDI. Clusters 2 and 3 were in the West and overlapping regions with low and very low SDI, respectively. The highest values of relative risks were in cluster 1 for CHIKV (1.97), in cluster 2 for ZIKV (1.58), and in cluster 3 for CHIKV (1.44). Regarding outcomes in the clusters, the Flavivirus had the highest frequency in clusters 1, 2, and 3 (42.83%, 54.46%, and 52.08%, respectively).CONCLUSION: We found an over-risk for arboviruses in areas with the worst socioeconomic conditions in Rio de Janeiro.

Time to Evaluate the Clinical Repercussions of Zika Virus Vertical Transmission? A Systematic Review,"do Amaral, YNDV; Malacarne, J; Brandao, PG; Brasil, P; Nielsen-Saines, K; Moreira, MEL","Background: Vertical transmission of Zika Virus (ZIKV) can be associated with several clinical features in newborn infants. The goal of the present review was to analyze the current state of knowledge regarding clinical repercussions following perinatal exposure to ZIKV in children up to 3 years of age.Methods: A systematic review of published studies was carried out, without the restriction of language or date of publication, identified in the databases PubMed, Virtual Health Library (BVS), Scopus, and Web of Science and the catalog for CAPES theses and dissertations. According to the proposed flowchart, the bibliographic search resulted in 1,563 papers. Of these, according to the eligibility criteria, 70 were selected for systematic review; all were published between 2016 and 2021.Results: Regarding clinical findings, 19 papers evaluated clinical imaging alterations, 21 ophthalmic manifestations, and 39 evaluated the central nervous system; of these, 15 analyzed neuro-psychomotor development. The remainder evaluated audiological (n = 14), nutritional (n = 14), orthopedic (n = 7), cardiorespiratory (n = 5), genitourinary (n = 3) or endocrinological (n = 1) manifestations.Conclusion: It is critical for studies to continue monitoring children with antenatal ZIKV exposure as they grow, given the unknown long-term repercussions of ZIKV and the recognized postnatal complications of this infection during pregnancy.

An overview of Zika virus genotypes and their infectivity,"Bernardo-Menezes, LC; Agrelli, A; Oliveira, ASLED; Moura, RRD; Crovella, S; Brandao, LAC","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus. It was first isolated from a sentinel monkey in Uganda in 1947. More recently, ZIKV has undergone rapid geographic expansion and has been responsible for outbreaks in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and America. In this review, we have highlighted the influence of viral genetic variants on ZIKV pathogenesis. Two major ZIKV genotypes (African and Asian) have been identified. The Asian genotype is subdivided into Southwest Asia, Pacific Island, and American strains, and is responsible for most outbreaks. Non-synonymous mutations in ZIKV proteins C, prM, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, and NS4B were found to have a higher prevalence and association with virulent strains of the Asian genotype. Consequently, the Asian genotype appears to have acquired higher cellular permissiveness, tissue persistence, and viral tropism in human neural cells. Therefore, mutations in specific coding regions of the Asian genotype may enhance ZIKV infectivity. Considering that mutations in the genomes of emerging viruses may lead to new virulent variants in humans, there is a potential for the re-emergence of new ZIKV cases in the future.",2022,,REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL,55,,,WOS:000886540700008,10.1590/0037-8682-0263-2022,,#6229,Bernardo-Menezes 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-03-23 02:58:02)(Screen): yes might have mutation rates; Extractor (2024-03-23 02:45:08)(Screen): important genes?; ,

To describe the clinical and epidemiological profile of cases with confirmed microcephaly or central nervous system (CNS) findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection and other infectious etiologies in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from November 2015 to July 2017.Method. A cross-sectional study was performed with 298 cases (as defined by the Ministry of Health) communicated to the Rio de Janeiro State Department of Health in the study period. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, radiological, and laboratory variables were assessed. Descriptive bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between specific factors and death outcome.Results. The median age of mothers was 24 years; 30.9% reported fever and 64.8% reported a rash during pregnancy. The median head circumference at birth was 29 cm, and median birth weight was 2 635 g. An etiological diagnosis of congenital Zika was made in 46.0%, whereas 13.8% were diagnosed with syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex infections (STORCH), with predominance of syphilis, and 40.3% had an unspecified infectious agent. CNS findings other than microcephaly were observed in 88.3%, especially intracranial calcifications, ventriculomegaly, and brain atrophy. Overall lethality was 7.0% - 19.0% in laboratory confirmed Zika cases and 22.2% in toxoplasmosis cases. Multivariable analysis revealed birth weight as the main predictor of death.Conclusions.

"Review of dengue, zika and chikungunya infections in nervous system in endemic areas","Puccioni-Sohler, M; Soares, CN; Christo, PP; Almeida, SMD","Dengue, zika, and chikungunya are arboviruses of great epidemiological relevance worldwide. The emergence and re-emergence of viral infections transmitted by mosquitoes constitute a serious human public health problem. The neurological manifestations caused by these viruses have a high potential for death or sequelae. The complications that occur in the nervous system associated with arboviruses can be a challenge for diagnosis and treatment. In endemic areas, suspected cases should include acute encephalitis, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, polyradiculoneuritis, and/or other syndromes of the central or peripheral nervous system, in the absence of a known explanation. The confirmation diagnosis is based on viral (isolation or RT-PCR) or antigens detection in tissues, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or other body fluids, increase in IgG antibody titers between paired serum samples, specific IgM antibody in cerebrospinal fluid and serological conversion to IgM between paired serum samples (non-reactive in the acute phase and reactive in the convalescent). The cerebrospinal fluid examination can demonstrate: 1. etiological agent; 2. inflammatory reaction or protein-cytological dissociation depending on the neurological condition; 3. specific IgM, 4. intrathecal synthesis of specific IgG (dengue and chikungunya); 5. exclusion of other infectious agents. The treatment of neurological complications aims to improve the symptoms, while the vaccine represents the great hope for the control and prevention of neuroinvasive arboviruses.

Nutritional profile of newborns with microcephaly and factors associated with worse outcomes,"dos Santos, SFM; Soares, FVM; de Abranches, AD; da Costa, ACC; Gomes, SD; Fonseca, VD; Moreira, MEL","OBJECTIVE: To describe the nutritional profile of newborns with microcephaly and factors associated with worse outcomes during the first 14 days of life.METHODS: This investigation is a longitudinal, descriptive study carried out in 21 full-term neonates exposed vertically to the Zika virus and hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit from February to September 2016. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition were excluded. Data analysis was performed using a generalized estimating equation model and Student's t-test to evaluate the association between worsening weight-for-age z-scores and independent clinical, sociodemographic and nutritional variables during hospitalization, with p < 0.05 indicating significance.RESULTS: During hospitalization, there was a decrease in the mean values of the weight-for-age z-scores. The factors associated with worse nutritional outcomes were symptomatic exposure to the Zika virus, low maternal schooling, absence of maternal income and consumption of infant formula (p <0.05). Calcification and severe microcephaly were also associated with poor nutritional outcomes. Energy and macronutrient consumption remained below the recommendations and had an upward trend during hospitalization.CONCLUSION: The presence of cerebral calcification, the severity of microcephaly and symptomatic maternal exposure to Zika virus affected the nutritional status of newborns. In terms of nutritional factors, human milk intake had a positive impact, reducing weight loss in the first days of life.

With the viruses being spread through a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, mosquito bites, fetal transmission, sexual contact, breast milk, and saliva, there is no doubt that more preventative measures are required.Recent FindingsThe changing epidemiology of the three viruses is already creating an impact, with the spread of Dengue in 2009 in Florida, to the 2013 spread of Chikungunya through the Caribbean, and now, the Zika virus making its mark on the tropics with major concerns of it spreading to the Western Hemisphere, including the USA. Although, they are all vector-borne illnesses, each carries its own clinical presentations that sometimes make it hard to diagnose. Collectively, there are no current vaccines or antiviral drugs against these three viruses, and with no sign of the spread slowing down, more geographic regions are in danger of being hit by these diseases in the near future.SummaryAs the evolving world for the three viruses continues due to changes in epidemiology, there is a dire need to develop vaccines for each of the three diseases that will target a variety of mechanisms to help fight the transmission and provide succor to affected communities. Public health preventive strategies need to be employed for proper actions to be take aimed at preventing viral transmission and ultimately, helping to fight this changing epidemiology of vector-borne diseases.",2019,,CURRENT TROPICAL MEDICINE REPORTS,6,3,145-159,WOS:000589390100006,10.1007/s40475-019-00181-2,,#6261,Sanyaolu 2019,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

Since their emergence in the Americas, chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses co-circulate with dengue virus (DENV), hampering clinical diagnosis. We investigated clinical and epidemiological characteristics of arboviral infections during the introduction and spread of CHIKV and ZIKV through northeastern Brazil.Methods. Surveillance for arboviral diseases among febrile patients was performed at an emergency health unit of Salvador, Brazil, between September 2014 and July 2016. We interviewed patients to collect data on symptoms, reviewed medical records to obtain the presumptive diagnoses, and performed molecular and serological testing to confirm DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV, or nonspecific flavivirus (FLAV) diagnosis.Results. Of 948 participants, 247 (26.1%) had an acute infection, of which 224 (23.6%) were single infections (DENV, 32 [3.4%]; CHIKV, 159 [16.7%]; ZIKV, 13 [1.4%]; and FLAV, 20 [2.1%]) and 23 (2.4%) coinfections (DENV/CHIKV, 13 [1.4%]; CHIKV/FLAV, 9 [0.9%]; and DENV/ZIKV, 1 [0.1%]). An additional 133 (14.0%) patients had serological evidence for a recent arboviral infection. Patients with ZIKV presented with rash and pruritus (69.2% each) more frequently than those with DENV (37.5% and 31.2%, respectively) and CHIKV (22.9% and 14.7%, respectively) (P <.001 for both comparisons). Conversely, arthralgia was more common in CHIKV (94.9%) and FLAV/CHIKV (100.0%) than in DENV (59.4%) and ZIKV (53.8%) (P <.001). A correct presumptive clinical diagnosis was made for 9%-23% of the confirmed patients.Conclusions. Arboviral infections are frequent causes of febrile illness.

Global Stability of Zika Virus Dynamics,"Bates, S; Hutson, H; Rebaza, J","The few mathematical models available in the literature to describe the dynamics of Zika virus are still in their initial stage of stability and bifurcation analysis, and they were in part developed as a response to the most recent outbreaks, including the one in Brazil in 2015, which has also given more hints to its association with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly. The interaction between and the effects of vector and human transmission are a central part of these models. This work aims at extending and generalizing current research on mathematical models of Zika virus dynamics by providing rigorous global stability analyses of the models. In particular, for disease-free equilibria, appropriate Lyapunov functions are constructed using a compartmental approach and a matrix-theoretic method, whereas for endemic equilibria, a relatively recent graph-theoretic method is used.

Hiding in plain sight: an evolutionary approach to the South American Zika outbreak and its future consequences,"Apari, P; Bajer, K; Brooks, DR; Molnár, O","Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) pose a world-wide health and socio-economic threat. Accelerating climate change and globalization are exposing unforeseen ways that pathogens cope with their surroundings. The 2015 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak was an example of expansion into previously inaccessible fitness spaces, causing a sudden epidemic. Recent studies indicating the subsequent decrease in symptomatic cases means the virus is in remission, currently poses little threat, and therefore can be ignored. We present an evolutionary scenario derived from the Stockholm Paradigm, of oscillating phases of expansion and isolation, accompanied by changes in transmission, persistence, virulence, and pathology. Chief among these is the likelihood that asymptomatic strains are constantly transmitted sexually. This suggests that the currently quiescent virus retains capacities to reemerge abruptly and spread rapidly in an arena of changing opportunity.",2019,,ZOOLOGIA,36,,,WOS:000499102100001,10.3897/zoologia.36.e36272,,#6370,Apari 2019,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study type (comment, letter, etc); Extractor (2024-03-19 07:52:30)(Screen): might have some mutation rates ? ; ",

The combined presence of ZIKV exposure and insecticide use was associated with lower ASQ fine motor scores (-3.9; 95% CI: 7.3, -0.4), and higher hyperactivity scores (0.8; 95% CI: 0.0, 1.5), compared to no exposure to either. A higher opposition score was observed in association with ZIKV exposure among non-users of insecticide (0.6; 95% CI: 0.0, 1.2).Conclusion: Adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months of age were observed with prenatal ZIKV exposure, and with higher magnitude when mothers reported use of household insecticides. At birth, rates of adverse fetal growth were however similar for the combined presence of exposure and either of the exposures.",2022,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,215,,,WOS:000877325400018,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114256,,#6389,Kadawathagedara 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Vector-borne transmission and evolution of Zika virus,"Gutiérrez-Bugallo, G; Piedra, LA; Rodriguez, M; Bisset, JA; Lourenco-de-Oliveira, R; Weaver, SC; Vasilakis, N; Vega-Rúa, A","Zika virus (ZIKV), discovered in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947, is a mosquito-borne flavivirus related to yellow fever, dengue and West Nile viruses. From its discovery until 2007, only sporadic ZIKV cases were reported, with mild clinical manifestations in patients. Therefore, little attention was given to this virus before epidemics in the South Pacific and the Americas that began in 2013. Despite a growing number of ZIKV studies in the past three years, many aspects of the virus remain poorly characterized, particularly the spectrum of species involved in its transmission cycles. Here, we review the mosquito and vertebrate host species potentially involved in ZIKV vector-borne transmission worldwide. We also provide an evidence-supported analysis regarding the possibility of ZIKV spillback from an urban cycle to a zoonotic cycle outside Africa, and we review hypotheses regarding recent emergence and evolution of ZIKV. Finally, we identify critical remaining gaps in the current knowledge of ZIKV vector-borne transmission.",2019,,NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION,3,4,561-569,WOS:000462542100017,10.1038/s41559-019-0836-z,,#6401,Gutiérrez-Bugallo 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-03-31 02:38:02)(Screen): doesn't contain any evolutionary mutation rates; ,
Vector distribution and transmission risk of the Zika virus in South and Central America,"Cunze, S; Kochmann, J; Koch, LK; Genthner, E; Klimpel, S","Background: Zika is of great medical relevance due to its rapid geographical spread in 2015 and 2016 in South America and its serious implications, for example, certain birth defects. Recent epidemics urgently require a better understanding of geographic patterns of the Zika virus transmission risk. This study aims to map the Zika virus transmission risk in South and Central America. We applied the maximum entropy approach, which is common for species distribution modelling, but is now also widely in use for estimating the geographical distribution of infectious diseases.Methods: As predictor variables we used a set of variables considered to be potential drivers of both direct and indirect effects on the emergence of Zika. Specifically, we considered (a) the modelled habitat suitability for the two main vector species Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus as a proxy of vector species distributions; (b) temperature, as it has a great influence on virus transmission; (c) commonly called evidence consensus maps (ECM) of human Zika virus infections on a regional scale as a proxy for virus distribution; (d) ECM of human dengue virus infections and, (e) as possibly relevant socio-economic factors, population density and the gross domestic product.Results: The highest values for the Zika transmission risk were modelled for the eastern coast of Brazil as well as in Central America, moderate values for the Amazon basin and low values for southern parts of South America. The following countries were modelled to be particularly affected: Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. While modelled vector habitat suitability as predictor variable showed the highest contribution to the transmission risk model, temperature of the warmest quarter contributed only comparatively little. Areas with optimal temperature conditions for virus transmission overlapped only little with areas of suitable habitat conditions for the two main vector species. Instead, areas with the highest transmission risk were characterised as areas with temperatures below the optimum of the virus, but high habitat suitability modelled for the two main vector species.Conclusion: Modelling approaches can help estimating the spatial and temporal dynamics of a disease. We focused on the key drivers relevant in the Zika transmission cycle (vector, pathogen, and hosts) and integrated each single component into the model. Despite the uncertainties generally associated with modelling, the approach applied in this study can be used as a tool and assist decision making and managing the spread of Zika.",2019,,PEERJ,7,,,WOS:000494937900003,10.7717/peerj.7920,,#6405,Cunze 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-06-17 19:28:03)(Select): model? not sure; ,

Co-circulation and misdiagnosis led to underestimation of the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic in the Americas,"Oidtman, RJ; España, G; Perkins, TA","During the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic, dengue and chikungunya-two other viral diseases with the same vector as Zika-were also in circulation. Clinical presentation of these diseases can vary from person to person in terms of symptoms and severity, making it difficult to differentially diagnose them. Under these circumstances, it is possible that numerous cases of Zika could have been misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya, or vice versa. Given the importance of surveillance data for informing epidemiological analyses, our aim was to quantify the potential extent of misdiagnosis during this epidemic. Using basic principles of probability and empirical estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, we generated revised estimates of reported cases of Zika that accounted for the accuracy of diagnoses made on the basis of clinical presentation with or without laboratory confirmation. Applying this method to weekly reported case data from 43 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, we estimated that 944,700 (95% CrI: 884,900-996,400) Zika cases occurred when assuming all confirmed cases were diagnosed using molecular methods versus 608,400 (95% CrI: 442,000-821,800) Zika cases that occurred when assuming all confirmed cases were diagnosed using serological methods. Our results imply that misdiagnosis was more common in countries with proportionally higher reported cases of dengue and chikungunya, such as Brazil. Given that Zika, dengue, and chikungunya appear likely to co-circulate in the Americas and elsewhere for years to come, our methodology has the potential to enhance the interpretation of passive surveillance data for these diseases going forward. Likewise, our methodology could also be used to help resolve transmission dynamics of other co-circulating diseases with similarities in symptomatology and potential for misdiagnosis.Author summaryIn 2016, the Zika epidemic in the Americas was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization, due to the finding that Zika virus infection was associated with microcephaly. In total, nearly 700,000 cases of Zika were reported to the Pan American Health Organization between 2015 and 2017. During this time, there were also nearly 4 million cases of dengue and chikungunya, diseases that share a common mosquito vector, and similar symptomatology, with Zika. In a region with co-circulation of these diseases, high potential for clinical misdiagnosis among these diseases has been found. This raises the question of how misdiagnosis could have affected reports of the overall size of the Zika epidemic. We addressed this question by leveraging passive surveillance data and empirical estimates of misdiagnosis to quantify the spatial and temporal extent of misdiagnosis between Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Our results suggest that, across the Americas, the Zika epidemic was likely larger than indicated by passive surveillance data taken at face value, but that conclusions about the overall size of the epidemic depend on assumptions made about sensitivities and specificities of laboratory diagnostic tests. We estimated that many misdiagnosed Zika cases occurred in 2015, prior to the start of reporting of Zika in most countries.",2021,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,15,3,,WOS:000625320300003,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009208,,#6424,Oidtman 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Cost-effectiveness of Prophylactic Zika Virus Vaccine in the Americas,"Shoukat, A; Vilches, T; Moghadas, SM","Zika virus remains a major public health concern because of its association with microcephaly and other neurologic disorders in newborns. A prophylactic vaccine has the potential to reduce disease incidence and eliminate birth defects resulting from prenatal Zika virus infection in future outbreaks. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a Zika vaccine candidate, assuming a protection efficacy of 60%-90%, for 18 countries in the Americas affected by the 2015-2017 Zika virus outbreaks. Encapsulating the demographics of these countries in an agent-based model, our results show that vaccinating women of reproductive age would be very cost-effective for sufficiently low (<$16) vaccination costs per recipient, depending on the country-specific Zika attack rate. In all countries studied, the median reduction of microcephaly was >75% with vaccination. These findings indicate that targeted vaccination of women of reproductive age is a noteworthy preventive measure for mitigating the effects of Zika virus infection in future outbreaks.",2019,,EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES,25,12,2191-2196,WOS:000504030700004,10.3201/eid2512.181324,,#6433,Shoukat 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-07-30 01:01:21)(Select): cost effectiveness study for vaccine only.

"Importation of dengue, Zika and chikungunya infections in Europe: the current situation in Greece","Emmanouil, M; Evangelidou, M; Papa, A; Mentis, A","Although several arboviruses-such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses-are not endemic in Europe, they have the potential to emerge following importation of the virus, taking advantage of the favourable climate and ecosystem. DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV are transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes and are amongst the most common travel-associated arboviruses. Furthermore, they are linked to sporadic, local outbreaks, especially in the southern parts of Europe. In this review we present in brief the DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV cases imported to Greece during the last 6 years (2013-2018), and we describe the recent laboratory data obtained from the Hellenic Pasteur Institute and the National Reference Centre for Arboviruses. We report 21 imported cases of DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV infections in travellers arriving in Greece. The probable origins were south-eastern Asian (71%) and north-central American (29%) countries. Furthermore, we stress the importance of early and accurate diagnosis in spite of a plethora of diagnostic challenges that clinicians and virologists have to face. Altogether, with the authorities' awareness and the preventive measures to be applied, local transmission events can be successfully avoided, especially in summer when the temperature is favourable for mosquito-borne infections.

Identifying high risk areas of Zika virus infection by meteorological factors in Colombia,"Chien, LC; Sy, F; Pérez, A","Background Several Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have occurred since October 2015. Because there is no effective treatment for ZIKV infection, developing an effective surveillance and warning system is currently a high priority to prevent ZIKV infection. Despite Aedes mosquitos having been known to spread ZIKV, the calculation approach is diverse, and only applied to local areas. This study used meteorological measurements to monitor ZIKV infection due to the high correlation between climate change and Aedes mosquitos and the convenience to obtain meteorological data from weather monitoring stations. Methods This study applied the Bayesian structured additive regression modeling approach to include spatial interactive terms with meteorological factors and a geospatial function in a zero-inflated Poisson model. The study area contained 32 administrative departments in Colombia from October 2015 to December 2017. Weekly ZIKV infection cases and daily meteorological measurements were collected. Mapping techniques were adopted to visualize spatial findings. A series of model selections determined the best combinations of meteorological factors in the same model. Results When multiple meteorological factors are considered in the same model, both total rainfall and average temperature can best assess the geographic disparities of ZIKV infection. Meanwhile, a 1-in. increase in rainfall is associated with an increase in the logarithm of relative risk (logRR) of ZIKV infection of at most 1.66 (95% credible interval [CI] = 1.09, 2.15) as well as a 1 degrees F increase in average temperature is significantly associated with at most 0.79 (95% CI = 0.12, 1.22) increase in the logRR of ZIKV. Moreover, after controlling rainfall and average temperature, an independent geospatial function in the model results in two departments with an excessive ZIKV risk which may be explained by unobserved factors other than total rainfall and average temperature. Conclusion Our study found that meteorological factors are significantly associated with ZIKV infection across departments. The study determined both total rainfall and average temperature as the best meteorological factors to identify high risk departments of ZIKV infection. These findings can help governmental agencies monitor at risk areas according to meteorological measurements, and develop preventions in those at risk areas in priority.",2019,,BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES,19,1,,WOS:000492859100004,10.1186/s12879-019-4499-9,,#6452,Chien 2019,Exclusion reason: not transmission model; ,
Inter- and intra-lineage genetic diversity of wild-type Zika viruses reveals both common and distinctive nucleotide variants and clusters of genomic diversity,"Collins, ND; Widen, SG; Li, L; Swetnam, DM; Shi, PY; Tesh, RB; Sarathy, VV","Zika virus (ZIKV) strains belong to the East African, West African, and Asian/American phylogenetic lineages. RNA viruses, like ZIKV, exist as populations of genetically-related sequences whose heterogeneity may impact viral fitness, evolution, and virulence. Genetic diversity of representative ZIKVs from each lineage was examined using next generation sequencing (NGS) paired with downstream entropy and single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis. Comparisons showed that inter-lineage diversity was statistically supported, while intra-lineage diversity. Intra-lineage diversity was significant for East but not West Africa strains. Furthermore, intra-lineage diversity for the Asian/American lineage was not supported for human serum isolates; however, a placenta isolate differed significantly. Relative in the pre-membrane/membrane (prM/M) gene of several ZIKV strains. Additionally, the East African lineage contained a greater number of synonymous SNVs, while a greater number of non-synonymous SNVs were identified for American strains. Further, inter-lineage SNVs were dispersed throughout the genome, whereas intra-lineage non-synonymous SNVs for Asian/American strains clustered within prM/M and NS1 gene. This comprehensive analysis of ZIKV genetic diversity provides a repository of SNV positions across lineages. We posit that increased non-synonymous SNV populations and increased relative genetic diversity of the prM/M and NS1 proteins provides more evidence for their role in ZIKV virulence and fitness.[GRAPHICS]",2019,,EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS,8,1,1126-1138,WOS:000477735400001,10.1080/22221751.2019.1645572,,#6453,Collins 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-03-23 04:53:13)(Screen): genes?; ,
Zika virus during pregnancy: From maternal exposure to congenital Zika virus syndrome,"Pomar, L; Musso, D; Malinger, G; Vouga, M; Panchaud, A; Baud, D","Zika virus (ZIKV), a vector-borne virus similar to dengue virus, was responsible for a global epidemic between 2013 and 2017 and has emerged as a new agent responsible for severe fetopathies. We present a review to describe the risks and complications of maternal and subsequent fetal infection by ZIKV. The risk of ZIKV infection during pregnancy depends on the incidence of the disease, which is highly variable in different affected geographic areas (less than 1% to 75%). Among infected pregnant women, the risk of any adverse fetal/neonatal outcome was estimated at 5% to 42%, with 1% to 4% of fetal loss and 4% to 9% of suspected congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The estimated rate of maternal-fetal transmission ranges between 7% and 26%, depending on the methodology of the study.Findings associated with CZS are microcephaly (33%-64%), ventriculomegaly (63%-92%), calcifications (71%-92%), malformations of cortical development (79%-82%), anomalies of the corpus callosum (71%-100%) and of the posterior fossa (21%-82%), arthrogryposis (10%-25%), eye abnormalities (25%), and extra-neurologic signs such as intra uterine growth restriction (14%), placentomegaly, transient hepatitis, mild anemia. Infants who present with CZS at birth suffer from motor abnormalities (77%-100%), epilepsy (9%-54%), hearing loss, and neurologic impairments.Prenatal ultrasound with advanced neurosonography and appropriate virological follow-up represent the state-of-the art approach to adequately monitor at-risk pregnancies, in order to diagnose early signs of CZS and to inform parents about the neonatal prognosis.",2019,,PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS,39,6,420-430,WOS:000468815400002,10.1002/pd.5446,,#6460,Pomar 2019,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

We describe the epidemiology of dengue, chikungunya, and noncongenital Zika virus disease cases reported from U.S. states and territories in 2017, including 971 dengue cases, 195 chikungunya cases, and 1,118 Zika virus disease cases. Cases of all three diseases reported from the territories were reported as resulting from local mosquito-borne transmission. Cases reported from the states were primarily among travelers, with only seven locally acquired mosquito-transmitted Zika virus disease cases reported from Texas (n = 5) and Florida (n = 2). In the territories, most dengue cases (n = 508, 98%) were reported from American Samoa, whereas the majority of chikungunya (n = 39, 100%) and Zika virus disease (n = 620, 93%) cases were reported from Puerto Rico. Temporally, the highest number of Zika virus disease cases occurred at the beginning of the year, followed by a sharp decline, mirroring decreasing case numbers across the Americas following large outbreaks in 2015 and 2016. Dengue and chikungunya cases followed a more seasonal pattern, with higher case numbers from July through September.

The recent outbreak of the Zika virus (ZIKV) is one such menace that shook the global public health community abruptly. Modern technologies, including computational tools as well as experimental approaches, need to be harnessed fast and effectively in a coordinated manner in order to properly address such challenges. In this paper, based on our earlier research, we have proposed a four-pronged approach to tackle the emerging pathogens like ZIKV: (a) Epidemiological modelling of spread mechanisms of ZIKV; (b) assessment of the public health risk of newly emerging strains of the pathogens by comparing them with existing strains/pathogens using fast computational sequence comparison methods; (c) implementation of vaccine design methods in order to produce a set of probable peptide vaccine candidates for quick synthesis/production and testing in the laboratory; and (d) designing of novel therapeutic molecules and their laboratory testing as well as validation of new drugs or repurposing of drugs for use against ZIKV. For each of these stages, we provide an extensive review of the technical challenges and current state-of-the-art. Further, we outline the future areas of research and discuss how they can work together to proactively combat ZIKV or future emerging pathogens.",2019,,PHARMACEUTICALS,12,4,,WOS:000505739800003,10.3390/ph12040157,,#6488,Basak 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-03-23 02:32:30)(Screen): review; ,
Warming temperatures could expose more than 1.3 billion new people to Zika virus risk by 2050,"Ryan, SJ; Carlson, CJ; Tesla, B; Bonds, MH; Ngonghala, CN; Mordecai, EA; Johnson, LR; Murdock, CC","In the aftermath of the 2015 pandemic of Zika virus (ZIKV), concerns over links between climate change and emerging arboviruses have become more pressing. Given the potential that much of the world might remain at risk from the virus, we used a previously established temperature-dependent transmission model for ZIKV to project climate change impacts on transmission suitability risk by mid-century (a generation into the future). Based on these model predictions, in the worst-case scenario, over 1.3 billion new people could face suitable transmission temperatures for ZIKV by 2050. The next generation will face substantially increased ZIKV transmission temperature suitability in North America and Europe, where naive populations might be particularly vulnerable. Mitigating climate change even to moderate emissions scenarios could significantly reduce global expansion of climates suitable for ZIKV transmission, potentially protecting around 200 million people. Given these suitability risk projections, we suggest an increased priority on research establishing the immune history of vulnerable populations, modeling when and where the next ZIKV outbreak might occur, evaluating the efficacy of conventional and novel intervention measures, and increasing surveillance efforts to prevent further expansion of ZIKV.",2021,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,27,1,84-93,WOS:000582780500001,10.1111/gcb.15384,,#6494,Ryan 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-05-01 22:19:20)(Select): use published model  ; ,

The participants were 499 pregnant women, classified into four subgroups, according to laboratory confirmation of infections: ZIKV-positive; ZIKV-positive and positive for another infection; positive for another infection but not ZIKV-positive; and not positive for any of the infections investigated. Hematological parameters were analyzed descriptively. The association between maternal infection and the hematological profile, along with the association between the maternal hematological profile and the gestational outcome, were tested. Similar hematic and platelet parameters were observed among pregnant women. However, a significant association was observed between low maternal lymphocyte count and a positive diagnosis for ZIKV (p < 0.001). The increase in maternal platelet count and the occurrence of unfavorable gestational outcome were positively associated. A similar hematic and platelet profile was identified among pregnant women, differing only in the low lymphocyte count among ZIKV-positive pregnant women.

Zika and Flavivirus Shell Disorder: Virulence and Fetal Morbidity,"Goh, GKM; Dunker, AK; Foster, JA; Uversky, VN","Zika virus (ZIKV) was first discovered in 1947 in Africa. Since then, sporadic ZIKV infections of humans have been reported in Africa and Asia. For a long time, this virus was mostly unnoticed due to its mild symptoms and low fatality rates. However, during the 2015-2016 epidemic in Central and South America, when millions of people were infected, it was discovered that ZIKV causes microcephaly in the babies of mothers infected during pregnancy. An examination of the M and C proteins of the ZIKV shell using the disorder predictor PONDR VLXT revealed that the M protein contains relatively high disorder levels comparable only to those of the yellow fever virus (YFV). On the other hand, the disorder levels in the C protein are relatively low, which can account for the low case fatality rate (CFR) of this virus in contrast to the more virulent YFV, which is characterized by high disorder in its C protein. A larger variation was found in the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID) in the C protein of various ZIKV strains. Strains of African lineage are characterized by higher PIDs. Using both in vivo and in vitro experiments, laboratories have also previously shown that strains of African origin have a greater potential to inflict higher fetal morbidity than do strains of Asian lineage, with dengue-2 virus (DENV-2) having the least potential. Strong correlations were found between the potential to inflict fetal morbidity and shell disorder in ZIKV (r(2) = 0.9) and DENV-2 (DENV-2 + ZIKV, r(2) = 0.8). A strong correlation between CFR and PID was also observed when ZIKV was included in an analysis of sets of shell proteins from a variety of flaviviruses (r(2) = 0.8). These observations have potential implications for antiviral vaccine development and for the design of cancer therapeutics in terms of developing therapeutic viruses that penetrate hard-to-reach organs.",2019,,BIOMOLECULES,9,11,,WOS:000502267900071,10.3390/biom9110710,,#6517,Goh 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-22 00:07:54)(Select): biological?; ,
"Effectiveness of environmental interventions to reduce entomological indices of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya vector","Osa, STL; Martín-Ruiz, E; Galán-Relaño, A; de Labry-Lima, AO","Vector-borne diseases are a major public health problem. Amongst them, dengue, Zika and chikungunya illnesses are increasing their incidence and geographical expansion. Since vector control is the main measure to prevent these diseases, this systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of environmental interventions for the prevention of the transmission of these three diseases, as well as for the reduction of their burden. Experimental studies of environmental management interventions aimed at vector control were included. The outcome vari-ables of interest were disease burden indicators and entomological indicators. Of the 923 references initially retrieved, after discarding those that were duplicated or didn't comply with the inclusion criteria, a total of 7 articles were included. All included studies carried out environmental manipulation interventions and only 1 carried out an environmental modification intervention. Regarding the outcome variables, all used entomolog-ical indicators (larval or pupae indices). Of those, pupae indices are better indicators of vector abundance. In 4 out of the 6 studies, there was a statistically significant reduction of the pupae indices related to the elimination of small containers, manipulation of large tanks and cleaning outdoor spaces. These interventions are easy to implement and involve little resources, which acquires special importance regarding areas with limited re-sources. Although it is assumed that a reduction of mosquitoes would lead to a reduction or the risk of trans-mission, a little evidence proving this has been published.

"Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus infections in Latin America and the Caribbean: a systematic review","Santos, LLM; de Aquino, EC; Fernandes, SM; Ternes, YMF; Feres, VCD","Objectives. To characterize the distribution profile of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus infections in Latin America and the Caribbean and to identify possible factors associated with the risk of dissemination and severity of these arboviruses.Methods. The protocol of this review was registered on the PROSPERO platform. Searches were carried out in the following databases: Virtual Health Library, MEDLINE/PubMed, and Embase. The search terms were: Zika virus, Zika virus infection, dengue, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, chikungunya fever, epidemiology, observational study, Latin America, and Caribbean region. Studies that addressed the distribution of these arboviruses and the risk factors associated with dengue, Zika virus disease, and chikungunya, published between January 2000 and August 2020 in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, were included.Results. Of 95 studies included, 70 identified risk factors, clinical manifestations, and outcomes for arbovirus infections and 25 described complications and/or deaths. The highest frequency of confirmed cases was for dengue. Brazil reported most cases of the three arboviruses in the period analyzed. Environmental and socio-economic factors facilitated the proliferation and adaptation of vectors, and host-related factors were reported to aggravate dengue. Most deaths were due to chikungunya, Zika virus disease caused most neurological alterations, and dengue resulted in greater morbidity leading to more frequent hospitalization.Conclusions. The review provides a broad view of the three arboviruses and the intrinsic aspects of infections, and highlights the factors that influence the spread of these viruses in the populations studied.",2023,,REVISTA PANAMERICANA DE SALUD PUBLICA-PAN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,47,,,WOS:000931298400001,10.26633/RPSP.2023.34,,#6537,Santos 2023,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-03-22 06:32:08)(Screen): review; ,Review
"Joint Estimation of Relative Risk for Dengue and Zika Infections, Colombia, 2015-2016","Martinez-Bello, DA; Lopez-Quilez, A; Prieto, AT","We jointly estimated relative risk for dengue and Zika virus disease (Zika) in Colombia, establishing the spatial association between them at the department and city levels for October 2015-December 2016. Cases of dengue and Zika were allocated to the 87 municipalities of 1 department and the 293 census sections of 1 city in Colombia. We fitted 8 hierarchical Bayesian Poisson joint models of relative risk for dengue and Zika, including area- and disease-specific random effects accounting for several spatial patterns of disease risk (clustered or uncorrelated heterogeneity) within and between both diseases. Most of the dengue and Zika high-risk municipalities varied in their risk distribution; those for Zika were in the northern part of the department and dengue in the southern to northeastern parts. At city level, spatially clustered patterns of dengue high-risk census sections indicated Zika high-risk areas.

Role of Prenatal Ultrasonography and Amniocentesis in the Diagnosis of Congenital Zika Syndrome <i>A Systematic Review</i>,"Viens, LJ; Fleck-Derderian, S; Baez-Santiago, MA; Oduyebo, T; Broussard, CS; Khan, S; Jones, AM; Meaney-Delman, D","OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between prenatal diagnostics (ultrasound examination and amniotic fluid Zika virus testing) and postnatal congenital Zika syndrome abnormalities.DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches were performed in 27 databases, including, from inception to July 1, 2019, for articles with the keywords ""Zika,"" ""prenatal,"" ""ultrasound,"" and ""amniocentesis.""METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: A total of 3,049 unique records were identified. Two reviewers independently assessed titles, abstracts, and full texts for relevance; 84 articles met the inclusion criteria. These articles describe 402 mother-fetus or mother-neonate dyads; 385 were included in the review of prenatal ultrasound examination, and 56 in the review of amniocentesis (39 in both).TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Among 195 fetuses with congenital Zika syndrome findings on prenatal ultrasound examination, postnatal congenital Zika syndrome abnormalities were reported for 153 (78%; 95% CI 7-84%). High proportions of microcephaly (76%; 95% CI 69-82%) and brain abnormalities (78%; 95% CI 69-86%) were confirmed postnatally. Among 190 fetuses without congenital Zika syndrome findings on prenatal ultrasound examination, 17% (95% CI 12-24%) had congenital Zika syndrome abnormalities identified postnatally. Structural congenital Zika syndrome abnormalities were identified postnatally in approximately equal proportions among dyads with and without Zika virus RNA detected in an amniotic fluid specimen (68% and 67%; 95% CI 52-82% and 95% CI 38-88%). In six pregnancies, Zika virus RNA was detected in amniotic fluid but not in a subsequent amniocentesis specimen.CONCLUSION: Prenatal ultrasound examination frequently detects structural findings associated with Zika virus infection; however, not all abnormalities are detected, and some may represent transient findings. As with other congenital infections, prenatal detection may vary with timing of infection, timing of ultrasound examination, technical expertise, and severity of abnormalities. The detection of Zika virus RNA in amniotic fluid in the included studies did not predict the risk for congenital Zika syndrome abnormalities in these cases, and clearance of Zika virus RNA from amniotic fluid appears possible after maternal infection. Diagnostic testing for Zika virus infection remains a shared decision between patients and clinicians, and more data are needed to define clinical predictors that will inform these decisions.

We investigate whether subnational Zika incidence is associated with changes in dengue incidence and find mixed results. Using simulations with multiple assumptions of interactions between DENV and ZIKV, we find cross-protection suppresses incidence of dengue following Zika outbreaks and low periods of dengue incidence are followed by resurgence.

"Spatial diffusion of the 2015-2016 Zika, dengue and chikungunya epidemics in Rio de Janeiro Municipality, Brazil","Dalvi, APR; Braga, JU","Different countries, especially Brazil, that have faced recurrent dengue epidemics for decades and chikungunya epidemics since 2014, have had to restructure their health services to combat a triple epidemic of arboviruses - Zika, dengue and Chikungunya - transmitted by the same vector, mainly Aedes aegypti, in 2015-2016. Several efforts have been made to better understand these three arboviruses. Spatial analysis plays an important role in the knowledge of disease dynamics. The knowledge of the patterns of spatial diffusion of these three arboviruses during an epidemic can contribute to the planning of surveillance actions and control of these diseases. This study aimed to identify the spatial diffusion processes of these viruses in the context of the triple epidemic in 2015-2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Two study designs were used: cross-sectional and ecological. Sequential Kernel maps, nearest-neighbour ratios calculated cumulatively over time, Moran global autocorrelation correlograms, and local autocorrelation changes over time were used to identify spatial diffusion patterns. The results suggested an expansion diffusion pattern for the three arboviruses during 2015-2016 in Rio de Janeiro. These findings can be considered for more effective control measures and for new studies on the dynamics of these three arboviruses.",2019,,EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION,147,,,WOS:000474555800001,10.1017/S0950268819001250,,#6594,Dalvi 2019,Exclusion reason: not transmission model; ,
Measuring the global burden of chikungunya and Zika viruses: A systematic review,"Puntasecca, CJ; King, CH; LaBeaud, AD","Throughout the last decade, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infections have spread globally, causing a spectrum of disease that ranges from self-limited febrile illness to permanent severe disability, congenital anomalies, and early death. Nevertheless, estimates of their aggregate health impact are absent from the literature and are currently omitted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) reports. We systematically reviewed published literature and surveillance records to evaluate the global burden caused by CHIKV and ZIKV between 2010 and 2019, to calculate estimates of their disability-adjusted life year (DALY) impact. Extracted data on acute, chronic, and perinatal outcomes were used to create annualized DALY estimates, following techniques outlined in the GBD framework. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020192502). Of 7,877 studies identified, 916 were screened in detail, and 21 were selected for inclusion. Available data indicate that CHIKV and ZIKV caused the average yearly loss of over 106,000 and 44,000 DALYs, respectively, between 2010 and 2019. Both viruses caused substantially more burden in the Americas than in any other World Health Organization (WHO) region. This unequal distribution is likely due to a combination of limited active surveillance reporting in other regions and the lack of immunity that left the previously unexposed populations of the Americas susceptible to severe outbreaks during the last decade. Long-term rheumatic sequelae provided the largest DALY component for CHIKV, whereas congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) contributed most significantly for ZIKV. Acute symptoms and early mortality accounted for relatively less of the overall burden. Suboptimal reporting and inconsistent diagnostics limit precision when determining arbovirus incidence and frequency of complications. Despite these limitations, it is clear from our assessment that CHIKV and ZIKV represent a significant cause of morbidity that is not included in current disease burden reports. These results suggest that transmission-blocking strategies, including vector control and vaccine development, remain crucial priorities in reducing global disease burden through prevention of potentially devastating arboviral outbreaks.Author summaryChikungunya and Zika are 2 mosquito-borne viral diseases that can cause both acute symptoms and long-term, debilitating complications in infected individuals. Chikungunya is best known as a cause of persistent arthritis in otherwise recovered patients and Zika as a cause of cognitive, motor, and sensory anomalies in newborn children. Both diseases emerged in the Americas within the last decade and have since spread rapidly throughout the region. Despite their widespread transmission there and throughout much of the world, chikungunya and Zika remain neglected diseases. One of the most significant obstacles to address their spread is a lack of data involving their burden. We searched the published literature and surveillance reports to collect information about the incidence, mortality, and morbidity associated with each of these diseases to estimate their regional and global burden during the last decade. Our estimates confirm that chikungunya and Zika caused substantial burden throughout this time frame and place them among the most problematic mosquito-borne viral diseases worldwide. We found that the largest proportion of global burden linked to each disease between 2010 and 2019 occurred in the Americas, although this observation is likely due to limited reporting in other regions.",2021,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,15,3,,WOS:000626603600005,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009055,,#6622,Puntasecca 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
In utero Zika virus exposure and neurodevelopment at 24months in toddlers normocephalic at birth: a cohort study,"Grant, R; Fléchelles, O; Tressières, B; Dialo, M; Elenga, N; Mediamolle, N; Mallard, A; Hebert, JC; Lachaume, N; Couchy, E; Hoen, B; Fontanet, A","BackgroundIn utero exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is known to be associated with birth defects. The impact of in utero ZIKV exposure on neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of in utero ZIKV exposure on neurodevelopment at 24months of age among toddlers who were born normocephalic to women who were pregnant during the 2016 ZIKV outbreak in French territories in the Americas.MethodsWe conducted a population-based mother-child cohort study of women whose pregnancies overlapped with the 2016 ZIKV epidemic in Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana. Infants were included in this analysis if maternal ZIKV infection during pregnancy could be determined, the newborn had a gestational age >= 35weeks, there were no abnormal transfontanelle cerebral ultrasound findings after delivery or no abnormal ultrasound findings on the last ultrasound performed during the third trimester of the mother's pregnancy, there was an absence of microcephaly at birth, and the parent completed the 24-month neurodevelopment assessment of the infant at 24months (1month) of age. ZIKV exposure of the toddler was determined by evidence of maternal ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Neurodevelopment assessments included the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) for five dimensions of general development-communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal-social skills; the Modified Checklist for Autism on Toddlers (M-CHAT) for behavior; and the French MacArthur Inventory Scales (IFDC) for French language acquisition.ResultsBetween June 2018 and August 2019, 156 toddlers with and 79 toddlers without in utero ZIKV exposure completed neurodevelopment assessments. Twenty-four (15.4%) ZIKV-exposed toddlers and 20 (25.3%) ZIKV-unexposed toddlers had an ASQ result below the reference -2SD cut-off (P=0.10) for at least one of the five ASQ dimensions.ConclusionIn one of the largest population-based cohorts of in utero ZIKV-exposed, normocephalic newborns to date, there were minimal differences apparent in neurodevelopment outcomes at 24months of age compared to ZIKV-unexposed toddlers at 24months of age.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02810210.

To determine the presence of the Zika virus (ZIKV) and abundance of its arthropod vectors we evaluated the socioeconomic implications involved in its transmission in two highly vulnerable Mayan communities in the state of Yucatan that practice backyard farming. An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out throughout 2016 to understand socioeconomic variables and seasonal patterns in mosquito populations. We selected 20 households from each community. Social exclusion indicators were analyzed, human and domestic animals were sampled, and mosquitoes were collected and identified. Four out of eight indicators of social exclusion were higher than the reported national averages. We captured 5,825 mosquitoes from 16 species being Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti the most abundant. The presence of chickens and human overcrowding in dwellings were the most significant factors (P = 0.026) associated with the presence of Ae. aegypti. Septic tanks (odds ratio = 6.64) and chickens (odds ratio = 27.41) in backyards were the main risk factors associated with the presence of immature states of Ae. aegypti in both communities. Molecular analysis to detect ZIKV was performed in blood samples from 416 humans, 1,068 backyard animals and 381 mosquito pools. Eighteen humans and 10 pig pools tested positive for ZIKV. Forty-three mosquito pools tested positive for flavivirus. Ten of the 43 pools of positive mosquitoes were sequenced, corresponding 3/10 to ZIKV and 1/10 to Dengue virus type 2. The findings obtained indicate the continuous circulation of Flavivirus (including ZIKV) in backyard environments in vulnerable communities, highlighting the importance of studying their transmission and maintenance in these systems, due that backyard animal husbandry is a common practice in these vulnerable communities with limited access to health services.",2022,,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,9,,,WOS:000894199300001,10.3389/fvets.2022.1057686,,#6664,Lopez-Apodaca 2022,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,

Robust Numerical Method to Solve a Mathematical Model Describing Zika Virus Disease,"Fundzama, BM; Patidar, KC","Mathematical models describing transmission of Zika virus disease are often autonomous systems of nonlinear ordinary differential questions which are sometimes very complicated or even impossible to solve analytically. This motivates the need for robust numerical solvers to obtain approximate solutions of such systems. However, it has been noticed that some classical solvers, such as, the standard Euler method or Runge-Kutta method, usually fail to preserve some qualitative features of the solution corresponding to the continuous systems. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel numerical method, known as the non-standard finite difference method, to solve a mathematical model describing the dynamics of Zika virus disease. This model is thoroughly analyzed to determine key qualitative features of the solution which are then used to test the applicability of the proposed numerical method to solve these types of models. Finally, a detailed theoretical analysis of the numerical method is carried out. Comparative numerical results supporting theoretical observations are also presented.",2020,,INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS ICNAAM 2019,2293,,,WOS:000636709500067,10.1063/5.0026470,,#6672,Fundzama 2020,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study type (comment, letter, etc); Extractor (2024-06-17 20:41:56)(Select): conference paper; ",

Dengue and Zika virus infections in children elicit cross-reactive protective and enhancing antibodies that persist long term,"Katzelnick, LC; Zambrana, JV; Elizondo, D; Collado, D; Garcia, N; Arguello, S; Mercado, JC; Miranda, T; Ampie, O; Mercado, BL; Narvaez, C; Gresh, L; Binder, RA; Ojeda, S; Sanchez, N; Plazaola, M; Latta, K; Schiller, A; Coloma, J; Carrillo, FB; Narvaez, F; Halloran, ME; Gordon, A; Kuan, G; Balmaseda, A; Harris, E","Dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 (DENV1-4) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses that induce both virus-specific and broadly reactive antibodies. A first DENV infection is thought to induce antibodies that wane over 2 years to titers that can subsequently enhance severe dengue disease. Secondary DENV infection with a different serotype is thought to induce stable, cross-serotype protective antibodies. Low dengue disease incidence after the recent Zika pandemic led to the hypothesis that ZIKV infection is also transiently cross protective. We investigated antibody kinetics in 4189 children up to 11 years after one and multiple DENV and ZIKV infections in longitudinal cohorts in Nicaragua. We used a DENV inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA), which measures antibodies associated with protection against dengue and Zika disease and with enhancement of dengue disease severity. Unexpectedly, we found that overall DENV iELISA titers stabilized by 8 months after primary DENV infection to a half-life longer than a human life and waned, although gradually, after secondary DENV infection. Similarly, DENV iELISA titers were stable or rose after primary ZIKV infection but declined in individuals with histories of DENV and ZIKV infection. In contrast, kinetics of anti-ZIKV antibodies after ZIKV infection were similar regardless of prior DENV immunity. We observed heterogeneity in DENV iELISA titer, suggesting that individual antibody titer set point, rather than waning, is important for future dengue disease risk. Together, these findings change our understanding of anti-flavivirus antibody kinetics and have implications for measuring vaccine efficacy and for predicting future dengue and Zika outbreaks.",2021,,SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE,13,614,,WOS:000704898400006,10.1126/scitranslmed.abg9478,,#6709,Katzelnick 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

The overall number of ZIKV-related cases increased until November 2016, after which it declined sharply. While the evaluation of the potential risk and impact of future arbovirus epidemics remains challenging, intensified surveillance efforts along with a scale-up of ZIKV whole-genome sequencing provide an opportunity to understand the patterns of genetic diversity, evolution, and spread of ZIKV. However, a classification system that reflects the true extent of ZIKV genetic variation is lacking. Our objective was to characterize ZIKV genetic diversity and phylodynamics, identify genomic footprints of differentiation patterns, and propose a dynamic classification system that reflects its divergence levels. We analysed a curated dataset of 762 publicly available sequences spanning the full-length coding region of ZIKV from across its geographical span and collected between 1947 and 2021. The definition of genetic groups was based on comprehensive evolutionary dynamics analyses, which included recombination and phylogenetic analyses, within- and between-group pairwise genetic distances comparison, detection of selective pressure, and clustering analyses. Evidence for potential recombination events was detected in a few sequences. However, we argue that these events are likely due to sequencing errors as proposed in previous studies. There was evidence of strong purifying selection, widespread across the genome, as also detected for other arboviruses. A total of 50 sites showed evidence of positive selection, and for a few of these sites, there was amino acid (AA) differentiation between genetic clusters. Two main genetic clusters were defined, ZA and ZB, which correspond to the already characterized 'African' and 'Asian' genotypes, respectively. Within ZB, two subgroups, ZB.1 and ZB.2, represent the Asiatic and the American (and Oceania) lineages, respectively. ZB.1 is further subdivided into ZB.1.0 (a basal Malaysia sequence sampled in the 1960s and a recent Indian sequence), ZB.1.1 (South-Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, and Micronesia sequences), and ZB.1.2 (very similar sequences from the outbreak in Singapore). ZB.2 is subdivided into ZB.2.0 (basal American sequences and the sequences from French Polynesia, the putative origin of South America introduction), ZB.2.1 (Central America), and ZB.2.2 (Caribbean and North America). This classification system does not use geographical references and is flexible to accommodate potential future lineages. It will be a helpful tool for studies that involve analyses of ZIKV genomic variation and its association with pathogenicity and serve as a starting point for the public health surveillance and response to on-going and future epidemics and to outbreaks that lead to the emergence of new variants.",2022,,VIRUS EVOLUTION,8,1,,WOS:000788263700001,10.1093/ve/veac029,,#6710,Seabra 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-23 00:05:26)(Select): no substitution or mutation rates; ,

Zika virus infection and microcephaly: spatial analysis and socio-environmental determinants in a region of high <i>Aedes aegypti</i> infestation in the Central-West Region of Brazil,"Nunes, PS; Guimaraes, RA; Martelli, CMT; de Souza, WV; Turchi, MD","Background More than 5 years after the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, Zika infection remains a major concern in regions with high Aedes infestation. The objectives of this study were (i) to identify clusters of ZIKV infection and microcephaly, and/or central nervous system (CNS) alterations associated with congenital infection during the epidemic peak in 2016 and subsequently, in 2017 and 2018; (ii) to measure the non-spatial correlation between ZIKV infection and microcephaly and/or CNS alterations associated with congenital infection; and (iii) to analyse the sociodemographic/economic, health, and environmental determinants associated with the incidence of ZIKV in a region of high infestation by Aedes aegypti in the Central-West Region of Brazil. Methods This ecological study analysed 246 municipalities in the state of Goias (6.9 million inhabitants). The data were obtained from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (ZIKV cases) and the Public Health Event Registry (microcephaly and/or CNS alterations associated with congenital infection). Incidence rates and prevalence of ZIKA infection were smoothed by an empirical Bayesian estimator (LEbayes), producing the local empirical Bayesian rate (LEBR). In the spatial analysis, ZIKV infection and microcephaly cases were georeferenced by the municipality of residence for 2016 and grouped for 2017 and 2018. Global Moran's I and the Hot Spot Analysis tool (Getis-Ord Gi* statistics) were used to analyse the spatial autocorrelation and clusters of ZIKV infection and microcephaly, respectively. A generalised linear model from the Poisson family was used to assess the association between ecological determinants and the smoothing incidence rate of ZIKV infection. Results A total of 9892 cases of acute ZIKV infection and 121 cases of microcephaly were confirmed. The mean LEBR of the ZIKV infection in the 246 municipalities was 22.3 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2016, and 10.3 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2017 and 2018. The LEBR of the prevalence rate of microcephaly and/or CNS alterations associated with congenital infection was 7 cases/10,000 live births in 2016 and 2 cases/10,000 live births during 2017-2018. Hotspots of ZIKV infection and microcephaly cases were identified in the capital and neighbouring municipalities in 2016, with new clusters in the following years. In a multiple regression Poisson analysis, ZIKV infection was associated with higher population density, the incidence of dengue, Aedes larvae infestation index, and average rainfall. The important determinant of ZIKV infection incidence reduction was the increase in households attended by endemic disease control agents.

Health-Related Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders Most Commonly Associated With Zika-Virus Infection: A Systematic Review,"RADAM-LAC Res Team; Miranda, RN; Ximenes, R; Gebretekle, GB; Bielecki, JM; Sander, B","Objectives: In this systematic review, we synthesize the current evidence on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for the two of the most relevant outcomes of Zika virus infection in humans, microcephaly and Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS).Methods: We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, WHO's ICTRP clinical trials registries database and PROSPERO. Search terms included quality of life, microcephaly, and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. We included primary studies where HRQoL was quantitatively assessed for microcephaly and GBS using validated instruments. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools to assess the risk of bias of individual studies.Results: From a total of 1,657 abstracts screened and 66 full texts reviewed, 21 studies met the eligibility criteria; one study for microcephaly and 20 for GBS. Adjusted disutilities for microcephaly compared to a normative childhood utility ranged from 20.745 to 20.820. For GBS, time traded-off the expected lifetime ranged from 16 days to 3 years. HRQoL follows the clinical course of GBS, with lower scores in the first months, recovery within the first year post onset, and stabilization after one year.Conclusions: Included studies reported a wide range of HRQoL for GBS, due in part to a high level of heterogeneity in methods, inclusion criteria, follow-up and reporting of results.

"Sociodemographic and environmental factors associated with dengue, Zika, and chikungunya among adolescents from two Brazilian capitals","Dalvi, APR; Gibson, G; Ramos, AN; Bloch, KV; de Sousa, GD; da Silva, TLN; Braga, JU; Castro, MC; Werneck, GL","Among the emerging and reemerging arboviral diseases, Zika, dengue and chikungunya deserve special attention due to their wide geographical distribution and clinical severity. The three arboviruses are transmitted by the same vector and can present similar clinical syndromes, bringing challenges to their identification and register. Demographic characteristics and individual and contextual social factors have been associated with the three arboviral diseases. However, little is known about such associations among adolescents, whose relationships with the social environment are different from those of adult populations, implying potentially different places, types, and degrees of exposure to the vector, particularly in the school context. This study aims to identify sociodemographic and environmental risk factors for the occurrence of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya in a cohort of adolescents from the Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents-ERICA-in the cities of Rio de Janeiro/RJ and Fortaleza/CE, from January 2015 to March 2019. Cases were defined as adolescents with laboratory or clinical-epidemiological diagnosis of Zika, dengue, or chikungunya, notified and registered in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN). The cases were identified by linkage between the databases of the ERICA cohort and of SINAN. Multilevel Cox regression was employed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) as measures of association and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). In comparison with adolescents living in lower socioeconomic conditions, the risk of becoming ill due to any of the three studied arboviral diseases was lower among those living in better socioeconomic conditions (HR = 0.43; 95%CI: 0.19-0.99; p = 0.047) and in the adolescents who attended school in the afternoon period (HR = 0.17; 95%CI: 0.06-0.47; p<0.001). When compared to areas whose Building Infestation Index (BII) for Aedes aegypti was considered satisfactory, a BII in the school region classified as ""alert"" and ""risk"" was associated with a higher risk of arboviral diseases (HR = 1.62, 95%CI: 0.98-2.70; p = 0.062; HR = 3.72, 95%CI: 1.27-10.9; p = 0.017, respectively). These findings indicate that living in less favored socioeconomic conditions, attending school in the morning, and having a high BII for Ae. aegypti in school's region can contribute to an increased risk of infection by Zika, dengue, or chikungunya in adolescents. The identification of residential or school areas based on those variables can contribute to the implementation of control measures in population groups and priority locations.Author summaryZika, dengue, and chikungunya are arbovirus with a wide geographic distribution that can cause serious diseases. The three pathogens are transmitted by the same vector and can present similar symptoms, hindering their identification and register. Despite the great efforts to control arboviruses diseases, Brazil still registers frequently epidemics. Scientific evidence of the association of the environment, vectors, humans, and their behaviors in the arbovirus transmission is vast, but little in know about those association in adolescents. This study focused on adolescents, a part of the population whose relationships with the social environment are different from those of adult and child populations, implying different types, and degrees of exposure to the vector, particularly in the school context. For this reason, this study aims to identify sociodemographic and environmental factors associated with Zika, dengue, and chikungunya disease in adolescents in Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza municipalities in Brazil from 2015 to 2019. The results obtained in this study highlight factors that may be influencing the transmission of Zika, dengue and Chikungunya, enabling effective measures to be implemented in the school context to control these arboviruses.",2023,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,17,3,,WOS:000953056300002,10.1371/journal.pntd.0011197,,#6777,Dalvi 2023,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,
Recent progresses and remaining challenges for the detection of Zika virus,"Zhang, XL; Li, GL; Chen, G; Zhu, N; Wu, D; Wu, YN; James, TD","Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a particularly notorious mosquito-borne flavivirus, which can lead to a devastating congenital syndrome in the fetuses of pregnant mothers (e.g., microcephaly, spasticity, craniofacial disproportion, miscarriage, and ocular abnormalities) and cause the autoimmune disorder Guillain-Barre' syndrome of adults. Due to its severity and rapid dispersal over several continents, ZIKV has been acknowledged to be a global health concern by the World Health Organization. Unfortunately, the ZIKV has recently resurged in India with the potential for devastating effects. Researchers from all around the world have worked tirelessly to develop effective detection strategies and vaccines for the prevention and control of ZIKV infection. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the most recent research into ZIKV, including the structural biology and evolution, historical overview, pathogenesis, symptoms, and transmission. We then focus on the detection strategies for ZIKV, including viral isolation, serological assays, molecular assays, sensing methods, reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification, transcription-mediated amplification technology, reverse transcription strand invasion based amplification, bioplasmonic paper-based device, and reverse transcription isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification.

Here, we analyze the epidemiological profile of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV at the serological and molecular level in patients with suspected infection with these arboviruses in the city of Juazeiro do Norte, Ceara, Brazil. Methods In 2016, the Central Public Health Laboratory (LACEN) of Juazeiro do Norte received 182 plasma samples from patients who visited health facilities with symptoms compatible with arbovirus infection. The LACEN performed serological tests for detection of IgM/IgG to DENV and CHIKV. They then sent these samples to the Retrovirology Laboratory of the Federal University of Sao Paulo and Faculty of Medical of the ABC where molecular analyses to confirm the infection by DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV were performed. The prevalence of IgM/IgG antibodies and of infections confirmed by RT-qPCR were presented with 95% confidence interval.

Coordination among neighbors improves the efficacy of Zika control despite economic costs,"Lemanski, N; Schwab, SR; Fonseca, DM; Fefferman, N","Author summary Mosquito-borne viruses, such as Zika, are an urgent public health threat, particularly in tropical, low-income regions. Vector control, the main strategy for combatting outbreaks, can be challenging because the urban-adapted, container-breeding mosquitoes that transmit these viruses often exhibit metapopulation dynamics, where mortality in one population is compensated by migration from neighboring populations. The timing and spatial distribution of vector control efforts can therefore have a large impact on their efficacy. Using a model of virus transmission and vector population dynamics, we demonstrate that local mosquito control initiatives aimed at reducing the burden of Zika and other mosquito-borne infections are most effective when there is communication of surveillance findings among neighboring control agencies and coordination over the timing of mosquito reduction treatments. We find that local communication improves epidemic outcomes even when it imposes costs to resource-limited control agencies due to gains in the efficiency of mosquito control from spatial coordination.Emerging mosquito-borne viruses like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya pose a major threat to public health, especially in low-income regions of Central and South America, southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. Outbreaks of these diseases are likely to have long-term social and economic consequences due to Zika-induced congenital microcephaly and other complications. Larval control of the container-inhabiting mosquitoes that transmit these infections is an important tool for mitigating outbreaks. However, metapopulation theory suggests that spatiotemporally uneven larvicide treatment can impede control effectiveness, as recolonization compensates for mortality within patches. Coordinating the timing of treatment among patches could therefore substantially improve epidemic control, but we must also consider economic constraints, since coordination may have costs that divert resources from treatment. To inform practical disease management strategies, we ask how coordination among neighbors in the timing of mosquito control efforts influences the size of a mosquito-borne infectious disease outbreak under the realistic assumption that coordination has costs. Using an SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered)/metapopulation model of mosquito and disease dynamics, we examine whether sharing surveillance information and coordinating larvicide treatment among neighboring patches reduces human infections when incorporating coordination costs. We examine how different types of coordination costs and different surveillance methods jointly influence the effectiveness of larval control. We find that the effect of coordination depends on both costs and the type of surveillance used to inform treatment. With epidemiological surveillance, coordination improves disease outcomes, even when costly. With demographic surveillance, coordination either improves or hampers disease control, depending on the type of costs and surveillance sensitivity. Our results suggest coordination among neighbors can improve management of mosquito-borne epidemics under many, but not all, assumptions about costs. Therefore, estimating coordination costs is an important step for most effectively applying metapopulation theory to strategies for managing outbreaks of mosquito-borne viral infections.",2020,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,14,6,,WOS:000544602600010,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007870,,#6822,Lemanski 2020,"Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-23 00:14:40)(Select): only on mosquito control, no human compartments; ",

Mathematical models are powerful tools for assessing ZIKV spread and can reveal important information for preventing future outbreaks. We reviewed the literature and retrieved modelling studies that were developed to understand the spatial epidemiology of ZIKV spread and risk. We classified studies by type, scale, aim and applications and discussed their characteristics, strengths and limitations. We examined the main objectives of these models and evaluated the effectiveness of integrating epidemiological and phylogeographic data, along with socioenvironmental risk factors that are known to contribute to vector-human transmission. We also assessed the promising application of human mobility data as a real-time indicator of ZIKV spread. Lastly, we summarised model validation methods used in studies to ensure accuracy in models and modelled outcomes.

Host and viral mechanisms of congenital Zika syndrome,"Liang, B; Guida, JP; Do Nascimento, MLC; Mysorekar, IU","In 2015-2016, in the Americas, and especially in northeast Brazil, a significant number of cases of microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities were linked with an outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women. While maternal symptoms of ZIKV are generally mild and self-limiting, clinical presentation in fetuses and newborns infected is extensive and includes microcephaly, decreased cortical development, atrophy and hypoplasia of the cerebellum and cerebellar vermis, arthrogryposis, and polyhydramnios. The term congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS) was introduced to describe the range of findings associated with maternal-fetal ZIKV transmission. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, however non-vector-dependent routes are also possible. Mechanisms of maternal-fetal transmission remain unknown, and the trans-placental route has been extensively studied in animal models and in human samples. The aim of this review was to summarize recent studies that helped to elucidate the mechanism of CZS in animal models and observational studies. There are still challenges in the diagnosis and prevention of CZS in humans, due to the large gap that remains in translating ZIKV research to clinical practice.

Identified infections varied by location and time of year in different regions of Brazil. Transfusion recipients were likely exposed to viremic blood components.Background Except for public health case reports, the incidence of Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and dengue virus (DENV) infection are not available to assess the potential blood transfusion safety threat in Brazil. Methods Pools of 6 donation samples (MP6) left over from human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus nucleic acid testing were combined to create MP18 pools (3 MP6 pools). Samples were tested using the Grifols triplex ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV real-time transcription mediated amplification assay to estimate prevalence of RNAemia and incidence, and to compare these results to case reports in Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Recife, and Rio de Janeiro, from April 2016 through June 2019. Results ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV RNAemia were found from donors who donated without overt symptoms of infection that would have led to deferral. The highest RNAemic donation prevalence was 1.2% (95% CI, .8%-1.9%) for DENV in Belo Horizonte in May 2019.

This study aimed to analyze the space-time patterns of their occurrence and co-occurrence and their associated environmental and socioeconomic factors. Univariate (individually) and multivariate (co-occurrence) scans were analyzed for 608,388 and 162,992 cases of chikungunya and Zika, respectively. These occurred more frequently in the summer and autumn. The clusters with the highest risk were initially located in the northeast, dispersed to the central-west and coastal areas of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro (2018-2021), and then increased in the northeast (2019-2021). Chikungunya and Zika demonstrated decreasing trends of 13% and 40%, respectively, whereas clusters showed an increasing trend of 85% and 57%, respectively. Clusters with a high co-occurrence risk have been identified in some regions of Brazil. High temperatures are associated with areas at a greater risk of these diseases. Chikungunya was associated with low precipitation levels, more urbanized environments, and places with greater social inequalities, whereas Zika was associated with high precipitation levels and low sewage network coverage. In conclusion, to optimize the surveillance and control of chikungunya and Zika, this study's results revealed high-risk areas with increasing trends and priority months and the role of socioeconomic and environmental factors.",2023,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,13,1,,WOS:001094273200008,10.1038/s41598-023-42930-4,,#6877,Palasio 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-28 04:44:16)(Select): dont' explicitly say outbreak or epidemic but report cases; ,

In this prospective cohort study, we performed epilepsy screening in normocephalic EC alongside a parallel group of normocephalic unexposed children [Unexposed Children (UC)]. We compared the incidence rate of epilepsy among EC and UC at one year of life to global incidence rates. Pregnant women were recruited from public health centers during the ZIKV outbreak in Grenada, West Indies and assessed for prior ZIKV infection using a plasmonic-gold platform that measures IgG antibodies in serum. Normocephalic children born to mothers with positive ZIKV results during pregnancy were classified as EC and those born to mothers with negative ZIKV results during and after pregnancy were classified as UC. Epilepsy screening procedures included a pediatric epilepsy screening questionnaire and video electroencephalography (vEEG). vEEG was collected using a multi-channel microEEG (R) system for a minimum of 20 minutes along with video recording of participant behavior time-locked to the EEG. vEEGs were interpreted independently by two pediatric epileptologists, who were blinded to ZIKV status, via telemedicine platform. Positive screening cases were referred to a local pediatrician for an epilepsy diagnostic evaluation. Epilepsy screens were positive in 2/71 EC (IR: 0.028; 95% CI: 0.003-0.098) and 0/71 UC. In both epilepsy-positive cases, questionnaire responses and interictal vEEGs were consistent with focal, rather than generalized, seizures. Both children met criteria for a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and good seizure control was achieved with carbamazepine. Our results indicate that epilepsy rates are modestly elevated in EC. Given our small sample size, results should be considered preliminary. They support the use of epilepsy screening procedures in larger epidemiological studies of children with congenital ZIKV exposure, even in the absence of microcephaly, and provide guidance for conducting epilepsy surveillance in resource limited settings.Author summaryEpilepsy is a clinical concern in children with Congenital Zika Syndrome and microcephaly; however, it is unknown whether epilepsy rates are elevated in normocephalic children with prenatal Zika virus exposure. We found a modest elevation of epilepsy rates in the first year of life of exposed, relative to unexposed, children, despite no other neurological manifestations.

After years of sporadic reports in Africa, the three major outbreaks of this disease occurred in Yap Islands (2007), French Polynesia (2013-14) and South Americas (2015-16). Although, serological surveys suggested the presence of ZIKV in India in 1950s, cross-reactivity could not be ruled out. The first four proven cases of ZIKV from India were reported in 2017. This was followed by major outbreaks in the states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in 2018. Fortunately, the outbreaks in India were not associated with neurological complications. These outbreaks in India highlighted the spread of this disease beyond geographical barriers owing to the growing globalization, increased travel and ubiquitous presence of its vector, the Aedes mosquito.

Furthermore, anthropogenic factors including sanitation, urbanization, and environmental pollution promote the transmission by affecting the mosquito density. In addition, socioeconomic factors such as poverty as well as social inequality and low-quality housing have also an impact since these are social factors that limit access to certain facilities or infrastructure which, in turn, promote transmission when absent (e.g., piped water and screened windows).

Associations of DNA Methylation Mortality Risk Markers with Congenital Microcephaly from Zika Virus: A Study of Brazilian Children Less than 4 Years of Age,"Nwanaji-Enwerem, JC; Van der Laan, L; Avakame, EF; Scott, KA; Burris, HH; Cardenas, A","Background: Zika virus (ZIKV)-associated congenital microcephaly is an important contributor to pediatric death, and more robust pediatric mortality risk metrics are needed to help guide life plans and clinical decision making for these patients. Although common etiologies of pediatric and adult mortality differ, early life health can impact adult outcomes-potentially through DNA methylation. Hence, in this pilot study, we take an early step in identifying pediatric mortality risk metrics by examining associations of ZIKV infection and associated congenital microcephaly with existing adult DNA methylation-based mortality biomarkers: GrimAge and Zhang's mortality score (ZMS).Methods: Mortality measures were calculated from previously published HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip data from 44 Brazilian children aged 5-40 months (18 with ZIKV-associated microcephaly; 7 normocephalic, exposed to ZIKV in utero; and 19 unexposed controls). We used linear models adjusted for chronological age, sex, methylation batch and white blood cell proportions to evaluate ZIKV and mortality marker relationships.Results: We observed significant decreases in GrimAge-component plasminogen activator inhibitor1 [PAI-1; beta = -2453.06 pg/ml, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3652.96, -1253.16, p = 0.0002], and ZMS-site cg14975410 methylation (beta = -0.06, 95% CI -0.09, -0.03, p = 0.0003) among children with microcephaly compared to controls.

Vaccination was dominant (i.e., saved costs and provided beneficial health effects) when the infection risk was >= 0.1% for a vaccine efficacy >= 75% and when the infection risk was >= 0.5% for a vaccine efficacy >= 25%, for scenarios where vaccination conferred a 1-year duration of protection and cost <=$200. In some cases, the vaccine was cost effective when the risk was as low as 0.015%, the cost was as high as $7,500 (INT$10,000), the efficacy was as low as 25%, and the duration of protection was 1 year.Conclusions: The thresholds at which vaccination becomes cost effective and cost saving can provide targets for Zika vaccine development and implementation.

Geospatial modeling of microcephaly and zika virus spread patterns in Brazil,"Amaral, P; de Carvalho, LR; Rocha, TAH; da Silva, NC; Vissoci, JRN","Microcephaly and Zika Virus infection (ZIKV) were declared Public Health Emergencies of International Concern by the World Health Organization in 2016. Brazil was considered the epicenter of the outbreak. However, the occurrence of both ZIKV and microcephaly in Brazil was not evenly distributed across the country. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigate regional characteristics at the municipal level that can be associated with the incidence of microcephaly, our response variable, and its relationship with ZIKV and other predictors. All epidemiological data in this study was provided by the Ministry of Health official database (DATASUS). Microcephaly was only confirmed after birth and the diagnostic was made regardless of the mother's ZIKV status. Using exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial autoregressive Tobit models, our results show that microcephaly incidence is significantly, at 95% confidence level, related not only to ZIKV, but also to access to primary care, population size, gross national product, mobility and environmental attributes of the municipalities. There is also a significant spatial autocorrelation of the dependent variable. The results indicate that municipalities that show a high incidence of microcephaly tend to be clustered in space and that incidence of microcephaly varies considerably across regions when correlated only with ZIKV, i.e. that ZIKV alone cannot explain the differences in microcephaly across regions and their correlation is mediated by regional attributes.",2019,,PLOS ONE,14,9,,WOS:000532345500027,10.1371/journal.pone.0222668,,#6954,Amaral 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

"Spatiotemporal transmission dynamics of co-circulating dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses in Fortaleza, Brazil: 2011-2017","Kazazian, L; Neto, ASL; Sousa, GS; do Nascimento, OJ; Castro, MC","The mosquito-borne viruses dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya (CHIKV), now co-endemic in the Americas, pose growing threats to health worldwide. However, it remains unclear whether there exist interactions between these viruses that could shape their epidemiology. This study advances knowledge by assessing the transmission dynamics of co-circulating DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV in the city of Fortaleza, Brazil. Spatiotemporal transmission dynamics of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV were analyzed using georeferenced data on over 210,000 reported cases from 2011 to 2017 in Fortaleza, Brazil. Local spatial clustering tests and space-time scan statistics were used to compare transmission dynamics across all years. The transmission of co-circulating viruses in 2016 and 2017 was evaluated at fine spatial and temporal scales using a measure of spatiotemporal dependence, the tau-statistic. Results revealed differences in the diffusion of CHIKV compared to previous DENV epidemics and spatially distinct transmission of DENV/ZIKV and CHIKV during the period of their co-circulation. Significant spatial clustering of viruses of the same type was observed within 14-day time intervals at distances of up to 6.8 km (p0.05). These results suggest that arbovirus risk is not uniformly distributed within cities during co-circulation. Findings may guide outbreak preparedness and response efforts by highlighting the clustered nature of transmission of co-circulating arboviruses at the neighborhood level. The potential for competitive interactions between the arboviruses should be further investigated.Author summaryMost of the global population is at risk of infection with dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses, all transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes. Although these viruses now circulate together in the Americas, it is not known how, if at all, they might interact inside co-infected vectors or hosts. Such interactions could serve as important determinants of transmission in the context of co-circulation. We used seven years of surveillance data from Fortaleza, the fifth largest city in Brazil, to investigate the potential effects of co-circulation on the transmission dynamics of the three Aedes-borne viruses. We found that, during years with co-circulation, different families of viruses (dengue/Zika and chikungunya) clustered in distinct areas of the city. This spatial clustering of viruses of the same type was maintained even within narrow time intervals. Transmission patterns in epidemic years with co-circulation deviated from patterns in previous epidemic years. Our findings suggest that co-circulation may alter the transmission dynamics of these mosquito-borne viruses. Further research is needed to confirm any competitive interactions between the viruses and to establish evidence-based public health recommendations for concurrent outbreaks.",2020,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,14,10,,WOS:000586610400004,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008760,,#6963,Kazazian 2020,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; Extractor (2024-05-24 07:44:40)(Select): combined zika and dengue in analyses; ,
Spatiotemporal Distribution of Zika Virus and Its Spatially Heterogeneous Relationship with the Environment,"Li, J; Jia, K; Liu, YX; Yuan, B; Xia, M; Zhao, WW","Infectious diseases have caused some of the most feared plagues and greatly harmed human health. However, despite the qualitative understanding that the occurrence and diffusion of infectious disease is related to the environment, the quantitative relations are unknown for many diseases. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that poses a fatal threat and has spread explosively throughout the world, impacting human health. From a geographical perspective, this study aims to understand the global hotspots of ZIKV as well as the spatially heterogeneous relationship between ZIKV and environmental factors using exploratory special data analysis (ESDA) model. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was used to analyze the influence of the dominant environmental factors on the spread of ZIKV at the continental scale. The results indicated that ZIKV transmission had obvious regional and seasonal heterogeneity. Population density, GDP per capita, and landscape fragmentation were the dominant environmental factors affecting the spread of ZIKV, which indicates that social factors had a greater influence than natural factors on the spread of it.

We evaluated 120 children conceived during the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in Paraiba, Brazil, who were approximately 24 months old, to assess functional outcomes. All children met either anthropometric criteria or laboratory criteria suggestive of possible congenital Zika virus infection. We collected results of previous medical evaluations, interviewed parents, and performed physical examinations and functional assessments, for example, the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). We compared patterns of neurologic outcomes and developmental delay at age 24 months by whether children met anthropometric or laboratory criteria, or both. Among children meeting both criteria, 60% (26/43) were multiply affected (had severe motor impairment, severe developmental delay, and suboptimal HINE scores), compared with 5% (3/57) meeting only laboratory criteria and none (0/20) meeting only anthropometric criteria. Of the remaining 91 children, 49% (45) had developmental delay, with more severe delay seen in children meeting both criteria. Although children meeting physical and laboratory criteria for potential congenital Zika virus infection were more severely affected, we did identify several children with notable adverse neurologic outcomes and developmental delay with no physical findings but potential laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection.

To maximise the effect of vector control, areas with persistently high numbers of Aedes-borne disease cases could be identified and prioritised for preventive interventions. We aimed to identify persistent Aedes-borne disease hotspots in cities across southern Mexico.Methods In this spatial analysis, geocoded cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika from nine endemic Mexican cities were aggregated at the census-tract level. We included cities that were located in southern Mexico (the arbovirus endemic region of Mexico), with a high burden of dengue cases (ie, more than 5000 cases reported during a 10-year period), and listed as high priority for the Mexican dengue control and prevention programme. The Getis-Ord Gi*(d) statistic was applied to yearly slices of the dataset to identify spatial hotspots of each disease in each city. We used Kendall's W coefficient to quantify the agreement in the distribution of each virus.Findings 128 507 dengue, 4752 chikungunya and 25 755 Zika clinical cases were reported between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2016. All cities showed evidence of transmission heterogeneity, with a mean of 17.6% (SD 4.7) of their total area identified as persistent disease hotspots. Hotspots accounted for 25.6% (SD 9.7; range 12.8-43.0) of the population and 32.1% (10.5; 19 & middot;6-50.5) of all Aedes-borne disease cases reported. We found an overlap between hotspots of 61.7% for dengue and Zika and 53.3% for dengue and chikungunya. Dengue hotspots in 2008-16 were significantly associated with dengue hotspots detected during 2017-20 in five of the nine cities. Heads of vector control confirmed hotspot areas as problem zones for arbovirus transmission.Interpretation This study provides evidence of the overlap of Aedes-borne diseases within geographical hotspots and a methodological framework for the stratification of arbovirus transmission risk within urban areas, which can guide the implementation of surveillance and vector control.

"Cross-Reactive Antibodies during Zika Virus Infection: Protection, Pathogenesis, and Placental Seeding","Zimmerman, MG; Wrammert, J; Suthar, MS","Humoral immunity is in essential component of the protective immune response to flavivirus infection. Typically, primary infection generates a robust neutralizing antibody response that mediates viral control and protection. It is becoming increasingly apparent that secondary infection with a closely related flavivirus strain can result in immunological cross-reactivity; however, the consequences to infection outcome remain controversial. Since its introduction to Brazil in 2015, Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused an epidemic of fetal congenital malformations within the Americas. Because ZIKV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with a high degree of sequence and structural homology to Dengue virus (DENV), the role of immunological cross-reactivity in ZIKV and DENV infections has become a great concern. In this review, we highlight contemporary findings that implicate a role for flavivirus antibodies in mediating protection, contributing to pathogenesis, and seeding the human placenta.",2020,,CELL HOST & MICROBE,27,1,14-24,WOS:000506213900006,10.1016/j.chom.2019.12.003,,#7026,Zimmerman 2020,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

"Re-emergence of arbovirus diseases in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: The role of simultaneous viral circulation between 2014 and 2019","Man, OM; Fuller, TL; Rosser, JI; Nielsen-Saines, K","The burden of arbovirus diseases in Brazil has increased within the past decade due to the emergence of chi-kungunya and Zika and endemic circulation of all four dengue serotypes. Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns may alter conditions to favor vector-host transmission and allow for cyclic re-emergence of disease. We sought to determine the impact of climate conditions on arbovirus co-circulation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We assessed the spatial and temporal distributions of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika cases from Brazil's national notifiable disease information system (SINAN) and created autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA) to predict arbovirus incidence accounting for the lagged effect of temperature and rainfall. Each year, we estimate that the combined arboviruses were associated with an average of 8429 to 10,047 lost Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). After controlling for temperature and precipitation, our model predicted a three cycle pattern where large arbovirus outbreaks appear to be primed by a smaller scale surge and followed by a lull of cases. These dynamic arbovirus patterns in Rio de Janeiro support a mechanism of susceptibility enhancement until the theoretical threshold of population immunity allows for temporary cross protection among certain arboviruses. This suspected synergy presents a major public health challenge due to overlapping locations and seasonality of arbovirus diseases, which may perpetuate disease burden and overwhelm the health system.",2022,,ONE HEALTH,15,,,WOS:000848514900003,10.1016/j.onehlt.2022.100427,,#7037,Man 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-21 23:00:25)(Select): model?; ,
Big Data to Knowledge Analytics Reveals the Zika Virus Epidemic as Only One of Multiple Factors Contributing to a Year-Over-Year 28-Fold Increase in Microcephaly Incidence,"Cifuentes, MP; Suarez, CM; Cifuentes, R; Malod-Dognin, N; Windels, S; Valderrama, JF; Juarez, PD; Valdez, RB; Colen, C; Phillips, C; Ramesh, A; Im, W; Lichtveld, M; Mouton, C; Przulj, N; Hood, DB","During the 2015-2016 Zika Virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Brazil, the geographical distributions of ZIKV infection and microcephaly outbreaks did not align. This raised doubts about the virus as the single cause of the microcephaly outbreak and led to research hypotheses of alternative explanatory factors, such as environmental variables and factors, agrochemical use, or immunizations. We investigated context and the intermediate and structural determinants of health inequalities, as well as social environment factors, to determine their interaction with ZIKV-positive- and ZIKV-negative-related microcephaly. The results revealed the identification of 382 associations among 382 nonredundant variables of Zika surveillance, including multiple determinants of environmental public health factors and variables obtained from 5565 municipalities in Brazil. This study compared those factors and variables directly associated with microcephaly incidence positive to ZIKV and those associated with microcephaly incidence negative to ZIKV, respectively, and mapped them in case and control subnetworks. The subnetworks of factors and variables associated with low birth weight and birthweight where birth incidence served as an additional control were also mapped. Non-significant differences in factors and variables were observed, as were weights of associations between microcephaly incidence, both positive and negative to ZIKV, which revealed diagnostic inaccuracies that translated to the underestimation of the scope of the ZIKV outbreak. A detailed analysis of the patterns of association does not support a finding that vaccinations contributed to microcephaly, but it does raise concerns about the use of agrochemicals as a potential factor in the observed neurotoxicity arising from the presence of heavy metals in the environment and microcephaly not associated with ZIKV. Summary: A comparative network inferential analysis of the patterns of variables and factors associated with Zika virus infections in Brazil during 2015-2016 coinciding with a microcephaly epidemic identified multiple contributing determinants.

This study aims to estimate the prevalence rate of these disorders in fetuses/neonates of pregnant women with confirmed or probable infection by Zika virus. A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted in November 2020. Cohort studies that contained primary data on the prevalence of unfavorable outcomes in fetuses or neonates of women with confirmed or probable Zika virus infection during pregnancy were included. A total of 21 cohort studies were included, with a total of 35,568 pregnant women. The meta-analysis showed that central nervous system abnormalities had the highest prevalence ratio of 0.06 (95% CI 0.03-0.09). Intracranial calcifications had a prevalence ratio of 0.01 (95% CI 0.01-0.02), and ventriculomegaly 0.01 (95% CI 0.01-0.02). The prevalence ratio of microcephaly was 0.03 (95% CI 0.02-0.05), fetal loss (miscarriage and stillbirth) was 0.04 (95% CI 0.02-0.06), Small for Gestational Age was 0.04 (95% CI 0.00-0,09), Low Birth Weight was 0.05 (95% CI 0.03-0.08) and Prematurity was 0.07 (95% CI 0.04-0.10). The positivity in RT-PCR for ZIKV performed in neonates born to infected mothers during pregnancy was 0.25 (95% CI 0.06-0.44). We also performed the meta-analysis of meta-analysis for microcephaly with the prevalence ratios from other two previously systematic reviews: 0.03 (95% CI 0.00-0.25).

In this ecological study of urban arboviruses performed from 2015 to 2019, we analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of these arboviruses in all 92 municipalities and nine health regions of Rio de Janeiro state. Annual cumulative incidences are presented for all three arboviruses throughout the study period. Spatial analyses of the three studied arboviruses showed distinct behaviors among municipalities and health regions. Co-circulation of the three arboviruses in the state and a heterogeneous spatiotemporal pattern was observed for each disease and region, with dengue having a higher annual incidence during the five years of the study, as well as two consecutive epidemic years in the state. The increase in transmission in different regions of the state in one year culminated in an epidemic in the state in the following year. A high annual cumulative incidence of chikungunya occurred in municipalities from 2017 to 2019 and of Zika only in 2016. Some municipalities with higher population densities showed higher incidences for some arboviruses and appeared to contribute to the dissemination to cities of lower demographic density and maintenance of these urban arboviruses. Thus, regions recording increased incidences of the three diseases in their territories for long periods should be considered municipal poles, as they initiated and sustained high transmission within their region.",2022,,TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE,7,7,,WOS:000834444400001,10.3390/tropicalmed7070141,,#7080,deAlmeida 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-03-22 06:26:41)(Screen): talks about cumulative incidence of Zika so might have attack rates; ,
"Exploring local and global regression models to estimate the spatial variability of Zika and Chikungunya cases in Recife, Brazil","dos Anjos, RS; Nóbrega, RS; Ferreira, HD; de Lacerda, AP; de Sousa-Neves, N","Introduction: In this study, we aim to compare spatial statistic models to estimate the spatial distribution of Zika and Chikungunya infections in the city of Recife, Brazil. We also aim to establish the relationship between the diseases and the analyzed geographical conditions. Methods: The models were defined by combining three categories: type of spatial unit, calculation of the dependent variable format, and estimation methods (Geographical Weighted Regression [GWR] and Ordinary Least Square [OLS]). We identified the most accurate model to estimate the spatial distribution of the diseases. After selecting the model that provided best results, the relationship between the geographical conditions and the incidence of the diseases was analyzed. Results: It was observed that the matrix of 100 meters (as the spatial unit) showed the highest efficiency to estimate the diseases. The best results were observed in the models that utilized the kernel density estimation (as the calculation of the dependent variable). In all models, the GWR method showed the best results. By considering the OLS coefficient values, it was observed that all geographical conditions are related to the incidence of Zika and Chiktmgunya, while the GWR coefficient values showed where this relationship was more noticeable. Conclusions: The model that utilized the combination of the matrix of 100 meters, kernel density estimation (as the calculation of the dependent variable) and GWR method showed the highest efficiency in estimating the spatial distribution of the diseases.

Enhanced mosquito vectorial capacity underlies the Cape Verde Zika epidemic,"Rose, NH; Dabo, S; Leal, SD; Sylla, M; Diagne, CT; Faye, O; Sall, AA; McBride, CS; Lambrechts, L","The explosive emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) across the Pacific and Americas since 2007 was associated with hundreds of thousands of human cases and severe outcomes, including congenital microcephaly caused by ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Although ZIKV was first isolated in Uganda, Africa has so far been exempt from large-scale ZIKV epidemics, despite widespread susceptibility among African human populations. A possible explanation for this pattern is natural variation among populations of the primary vector of ZIKV, the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Globally invasive populations of Ae. aegypti outside of Africa are considered effective ZIKV vectors because they are human specialists with high intrinsic ZIKV susceptibility, whereas African populations of Ae. aegypti across the species' native range are predominantly generalists with low intrinsic ZIKV susceptibility, making them less likely to spread viruses in the human population. We test this idea by studying a notable exception to the patterns observed across most of Africa: Cape Verde experienced a large ZIKV outbreak in 2015 to 2016. We find that local Ae. aegypti in Cape Verde have substantial human-specialist ancestry, show a robust behavioral preference for human hosts, and exhibit increased susceptibility to ZIKV infection, consistent with a key role for variation among mosquito populations in ZIKV epidemiology. These findings suggest that similar human-specialist populations of Ae. aegypti in the nearby Sahel region of West Africa, which may be expanding in response to rapid urbanization, could serve as effective vectors for ZIKV in the future.",2022,,PLOS BIOLOGY,20,10,,WOS:000924607000034,10.1371/journal.pbio.3001864,,#7105,Rose 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Modeling the Control of Zika Virus Vector Population Using the Sterile Insect Technology,"Atokolo, W; Ezike, GMC","This work is aimed at formulating a mathematical model for the control of mosquito population using sterile insect technology (SIT). SIT is an environmental friendly method, which depends on the release of sterile male mosquitoes that compete with wild male mosquitoes and mate with wild female mosquitoes, which leads to the production of no offspring. The basic offspring number of the mosquitoes' population was computed, after which we investigated the existence of two equilibrium points of the model. When the basic offspring number of the model (M-0)THORN, is less than or equal to 1, a mosquito extinction equilibrium point (E-2), which is often biologically unattainable, was shown to exits. On the other hand, if (M0 > 1), we have the nonnegative equilibrium point (E-1) which is shown to be both locally and globally asymptotically stable whenever (M-0 > 1) . Local sensitivity analysis was then performed to know the parameters that should be targeted by control intervention strategies and result shows that female mating probability to be with the sterile male mosquitoes (P-S), mating rate of the sterile mosquito (beta(2)), and natural death rates of both aquatic and female mosquitoeso(mu(A) + mu(F))THORN have greater impacts on the reduction and elimination of mosquitoes from a population. Simulation of the model shows that enough release of sterile male mosquitoes into the population of the wild mosquitoes controls the mosquito population and as such can reduce the spread of mosquito borne disease such as Zika.",2020,,JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS,2020,,,WOS:001022999700001,10.1155/2020/6350134,,#7117,Atokolo 2020,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-06-19 02:25:07)(Select): mosquito only; Extractor (2024-06-17 21:26:50)(Select): model; ,

Monitoring virus genotype diversity is crucial to understand the emergence and spread of outbreaks, both aspects that are vital to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, we developed an efficient method to classify virus sequences with respect to their species and sub-species (i.e. serotype and/or genotype). This tool provides an easy-to-use software implementation of this new method and was validated on a large dataset assessing the classification performance with respect to whole-genome sequences and partial-genome sequences.

These arboviruses are primarily transmitted by mosquitoes of the species Ae. Aegypti and its related diseases result in increased financial costs associated with diagnosis and treatment. To support the design of efficient diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies, a bioinformatics tool has been developed for the genotyping of these viruses based on appropriate evolutionary models in an automatic, accurate and rapid manner. A set of virus reference sequences was obtained from GenBank and used for the development of the tools. This process involved the alignment of the reference sequences followed by phylogenetic tree reconstructions. To assign the genotypes uploaded by the user, the tool analyses the sequences one by one, genotypes through identification, alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction. This computational method allows the high-throughput classification of these virus species and genotypes in seconds.

Clinical and Preclinical Evidence for Adverse Neurodevelopment after Postnatal Zika Virus Infection,"Raper, J; Chahroudi, A","Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) typically causes mild or no symptoms in adults, during the 2015-2016 outbreak, ZIKV infection in pregnancy resulted in a spectrum of diseases in infants, including birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders identified in childhood. While intense clinical and basic science research has focused on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of prenatal ZIKV infection, less is known about the consequences of infection during early life. Considering the neurotropism of ZIKV and the rapidly-developing postnatal brain, it is important to understand how infection during infancy may disrupt neurodevelopment. This paper reviews the current knowledge regarding early postnatal ZIKV infection. Emerging clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that ZIKV infection during infancy can result in negative neurologic consequences. However, clinical data regarding postnatal ZIKV infection in children are limited; as such, animal models play an important role in understanding the potential complications of ZIKV infection related to the vulnerable developing brain.

Backward bifurcation and optimal control in a co-infection model for SARS-CoV-2 and ZIKV,"Omame, A; Abbas, M; Onyenegecha, CP","In co-infection models for two diseases, it is mostly claimed that, the dynamical behavior of the sub-models usually predict or drive the behavior of the complete models. However, under a certain assumption such as, allowing incident co-infection with both diseases, we have a different observation. In this paper, a new mathematical model for SARS-CoV-2 and Zika co-dynamics is presented which incorporates incident co infection by susceptible individuals. It is worth mentioning that the assumption is missing in many existing co-infection models. We shall discuss the impact of this assumption on the dynamics of a co-infection model. The model also captures sexual transmission of Zika virus. The positivity and boundedness of solution of the proposed model are studied, in addition to the local asymptotic stability analysis. The model is shown to exhibit backward bifurcation caused by the disease-induced death rates and parameters associated with susceptibility to a second infection by those singly infected. Using Lyapunov functions, the disease free and endemic equilibria are shown to be globally asymptotically stable for R01, respectively. To manage the co circulation of both infections effectively, under an endemic setting, time dependent controls in the form of SARS-CoV-2, Zika and co-infection prevention strategies are incorporated into the model. The simulations show that SARS-CoV-2 prevention could greatly reduce the burden of co-infections with Zika. Furthermore, it is also shown that prevention controls for Zika can significantly decrease the burden of co-infections with SARS-CoV-2.",2022,,RESULTS IN PHYSICS,37,,,WOS:000798983300002,10.1016/j.rinp.2022.105481,,#7132,Omame 2022,Exclusion reason: Co-infection study; ,
A preliminary survey of Zika virus infection by nucleic acid test in the volunteer blood donor samples in Shenzhen China,"Zheng, X; Zeng, JF; Xu, XX; Liu, YZ; Heng, L; Wen, X; Li, SL; Xu, M; Wu, SB; Chen, YJ; Chen, LM","Although Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is mainly transmitted through mosquito bite, it can also be transmitted through blood transfusion.

Unfortunately, there were no data on ZIKV infection in Chinese blood donors because it has not been included in routine screening for volunteer blood donors. As such, we performed a preliminary survey of the prevalence of ZIKV infection among volunteer blood donors in Shenzhen, China, to assess the potential risk of ZIKV infection through transfusion.

Estimation of mosquito-borne and sexual transmission of Zika virus in Australia: Risks to blood transfusion safety,"Viennet, E; Frentiu, FD; Williams, CR; Mincham, G; Jansen, CC; Montgomery, BL; Flower, RLP; Faddy, HM","Background Since 2015, Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have occurred in the Americas and the Pacific involving mosquito-borne and sexual transmission. ZIKV has also emerged as a risk to global blood transfusion safety.Aedes aegypti, a mosquito well established in north and some parts of central and southern Queensland, Australia, transmits ZIKV.Aedes albopictus, another potential ZIKV vector, is a threat to mainland Australia. Since these conditions create the potential for local transmission in Australia and a possible uncertainty in the effectiveness of blood donor risk-mitigation programs, we investigated the possible impact of mosquito-borne and sexual transmission of ZIKV in Australia on local blood transfusion safety. Methodology/Principal findings We estimated 'best-' and 'worst-' case scenarios of monthly reproduction number (R-0) for both transmission pathways of ZIKV from 1996-2015 in 11 urban or regional population centres, by varying epidemiological and entomological estimates. We then estimated the attack rate and subsequent number of infectious people to quantify the ZIKV transfusion-transmission risk using the European Up-Front Risk Assessment Tool. For all scenarios and with both vector speciesR(0)was lower than one for ZIKV transmission. However, a higher risk of a sustained outbreak was estimated for Cairns, Rockhampton, Thursday Island, and theoretically in Darwin during the warmest months of the year. The yearly estimation of the risk of transmitting ZIKV infection by blood transfusion remained low through the study period for all locations, with the highest potential risk estimated in Darwin. Conclusions/Significance Given the increasing demand for plasma products in Australia, the current strategy of restricting donors returning from infectious disease outbreak regions to source plasma collection provides a simple and effective risk management approach. However, if local transmission was suspected in the main urban centres of Australia, potentially facilitated by the geographic range expansion ofAe.aegyptiorAe.albopictus, this mitigation strategy would need urgent review.Author summary What if Zika virus (ZIKV) had been introduced in Australia from 1996-2015 in urban centres with established mosquito vectors? Would Australian blood transfusion safety be compromised due to risks associated with ZIKV? In the event of ZIKV introduction into Australia during the period 1996-2015, our estimation shows that local transmission arising from an imported case, would have been possible in most of the selected urban centres, albeit very low. However, ZIKV transmission remained a potential threat in Cairns, Rockhampton, and Thursday Island during the warmest months. Potential geographic range expansion of bothAe.albopictusandAe.aegyptiis a key threat to the Australian mainland. We found that sexual transmission would have an important role in the estimation ofR(0)if only theAe.albopictuspopulation were present and notAe.aegypti. Had both vectors been established in Australia during the period investigated and a ZIKV introduction occurred, the associated risk to blood transfusion safety would have been low. We identified regions of Australia where ZIKV transmission presents a potential, however low, concern for blood supply safety.

Deficits in visual acuity (31%) and contrast sensitivity (23%) were apparent in the ZIKV-exposed infants in the absence of cognitive, motor, language or behavioural delays.Conclusions Overall neurodevelopment is likely to be unaffected in ZIKV-exposed children with normal head circumference at birth and normal head growth in the first 2 years of life. However, the visual system may be selectively vulnerable, which indicates the need for vision testing by 3 years of age.",2022,,ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD,107,3,244-250,WOS:000723306500001,10.1136/archdischild-2020-321031,,#7168,Blackmon 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Population-based surveillance of severe microcephaly and congenital Zika syndrome in Canada,"Morris, SK; Farrar, DS; Miller, SP; Ofner, M; Bitnun, A; Nelson, CRM; Shevell, M; Moore, AM; Tataryn, J; Evans, JA; Zipursky, AR; Hepburn, CM","Purpose To estimate the minimum incidence of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and severe microcephaly in Canada and describe key clinical, epidemiological, aetiological and outcome features of these conditions. Methods Two separate national surveillance studies were conducted on CZS and severe microcephaly using the well-established Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program from 2016 to 2019. Over 2700 paediatricians across Canada were surveyed monthly and asked to report demographic details, pregnancy and travel history, infant anthropometry, clinical features and laboratory findings of newly identified cases. Reports were reviewed to assign an underlying aetiology of severe microcephaly. Incidence rates were estimated using monthly live birth denominators. Results Thirty-four infants met the case definition for severe microcephaly and <5 met the case definition for CZS. The associated minimum incidence rates were 4.5 per 100 000 live births for severe microcephaly and 0.1-0.5 per 100 000 live births for CZS. Of severe microcephaly cases, 53% were attributed to genetic causes, 15% to infectious or ischaemic causes and 32% to unknown causes. The median head circumference-for-age Z-score at birth was -3.2 (IQR -3.8 to -2.6), and catch-up growth was often not achieved. Common clinical features included intracranial abnormalities (n=23), dysmorphology (n=19) and developmental delays (n=14). Mothers of infants with non-genetic aetiologies travelled during pregnancy more often (10/16) than mothers of infants with genetic aetiologies (<5/18; p<0.01). Conclusion Severe microcephaly and CZS are both rare in Canada. Minimum incidence rates can be used as a baseline against which novel or re-emergent causes of severe microcephaly or CZS can be compared.",2021,,ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD,106,9,855-861,WOS:000694654600013,10.1136/archdischild-2020-320968,,#7176,Morris 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-04-17 18:29:53)(Screen): risk factors?; ,

The spatial analysis was conducted at the neighbourhood level (urban settings). The socioeconomic measures were the median monthly household income (MMHI) for Brazil and the Socio-Economic Strata index (SES) in Colombia.Results There were 281 426 notified arboviral cases in Fortaleza and 40 887 in Medellin. We observed greater concentration of dengue among residents of low socioeconomic neighbourhoods in both cities: Relative Concentration Index = -0.12 (95% CI = -0.13, -0.10) in Fortaleza and Relative Concentration Index = -0.04 (95% CI = -0.05, -0.03) in Medellin. The magnitude of inequalities varied over time across sites and was larger during outbreaks. We identified a non-monotonic association between disease rates and socioeconomic measures, especially for chikungunya, that changed over time. The Relative Concentration Index and Absolute Concentration Index showed few if any inequalities for Zika. The socioeconomic-specific model showed increased disease rates at MMHI below US$400 in Brazil and at SES-index below level four, in Colombia.Conclusions We provide robust quantitative estimates of socioeconomic inequalities in arboviruses for two Latin American cities.

Global spatial assessment of<i> Aedes aegypti </i>and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>: a scenario of Zika virus exposure,"Alaniz, AJ; Carvajal, MA; Bacigalupo, A; Cattan, PE","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arbovirus transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Recent scientific evidence on Culex quinquefasciatus has suggested its potential as a vector for ZIKV, which may change the current risk zones. We aimed to quantify the world population potentially exposed to ZIKV in a spatially explicit way, considering the primary vector (A. aegypti) and the potential vector (C. quinquefasciatus). Our model combined species distribution modelling of mosquito species with spatially explicit human population data to estimate ZIKV exposure risk. We estimated the potential global distribution of C. quinquefasciatus and estimated its potential interaction zones with A. aegypti. Then we evaluated the risk zones for ZIKV considering both vectors. Finally, we quantified and compared the people under risk associated with each vector by risk level, country and continent. We found that C. quinquefasciatus had a more temperate distribution until 42 degrees in both hemispheres, while the risk involving A. aegypti is concentrated mainly in tropical latitudes until 35 degrees in both hemispheres. Globally, 4.2 billion people are under risk associated with ZIKV. Around 2.6 billon people are under very high risk associated with C. quinquefasciatus and 1 billion people associated with A. aegypti. Several countries could be exposed to ZIKV, which emphasises the need to clarify the competence of C. quinquefasciatus as a potential vector as soon as possible.

"Early warning systems (EWSs) for chikungunya, dengue, malaria, yellow fever, and Zika outbreaks: What is the evidence? A scoping review","Hussain-Alkhateeb, L; Ramirez, TR; Kroeger, A; Gozzer, E; Runge-Ranzinger, S","BackgroundEarly warning systems (EWSs) are of increasing importance in the context of outbreak-prone diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, malaria, yellow fever, and Zika. A scoping review has been undertaken for all 5 diseases to summarize existing evidence of EWS tools in terms of their structural and statistical designs, feasibility of integration and implementation into national surveillance programs, and the users' perspective of their applications. MethodsData were extracted from Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Google Scholar, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), PubMed, Web of Science, and WHO Library Database (WHOLIS) databases until August 2019. Included were studies reporting on (a) experiences with existing EWS, including implemented tools; and (b) the development or implementation of EWS in a particular setting. No restrictions were applied regarding year of publication, language or geographical area. FindingsThrough the first screening, 11,710 documents for dengue, 2,757 for Zika, 2,706 for chikungunya, 24,611 for malaria, and 4,963 for yellow fever were identified. After applying the selection criteria, a total of 37 studies were included in this review. Key findings were the following: (1) a large number of studies showed the quality performance of their prediction models but except for dengue outbreaks, only few presented statistical prediction validity of EWS; (2) while entomological, epidemiological, and social media alarm indicators are potentially useful for outbreak warning, almost all studies focus primarily or exclusively on meteorological indicators, which tends to limit the prediction capacity; (3) no assessment of the integration of the EWS into a routine surveillance system could be found, and only few studies addressed the users' perspective of the tool; (4) almost all EWS tools require highly skilled users with advanced statistics; and (5) spatial prediction remains a limitation with no tool currently able to map high transmission areas at small spatial level. ConclusionsIn view of the escalating infectious diseases as global threats, gaps and challenges are significantly present within the EWS applications. While some advanced EWS showed high prediction abilities, the scarcity of tool assessments in terms of integration into existing national surveillance systems as well as of the feasibility of transforming model outputs into local vector control or action plans tends to limit in most cases the support of countries in controlling disease outbreaks.",2021,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,15,9,,WOS:000724326200008,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009686,,#7205,Hussain-Alkhateeb 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

We isolated ZIKV from 20 children with acute undifferentiated febrile illness who were part of a cohort of children seen at a school clinic in the Gressier region of Haiti. The virus was also isolated from three pools of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected at the same location. On phylogenetic analysis, three distinct ZIKV clades were identified. Strains from all three clades were present in Haiti in 2014, making them among the earliest isolates identified in the Western Hemisphere. Strains from all three clades were also isolated in 2016, indicative of their persistence across the time period of the epidemic. Mosquito isolates were collected in 2016 and included representa-tives from two of the three clades; in one instance, ZIKV was isolated from a pool of male mosquitoes, suggestive of verti-cal transmission of the virus.

"Multiscale analysis for patterns of Zika virus genotype emergence, spread, and consequence","Borucki, MK; Collette, NM; Coffey, LL; Van Rompay, KKA; Hwang, MH; Thissen, JB; Allen, JE; Zemla, AT","The question of how Zika virus (ZIKV) changed from a seemingly mild virus to a human pathogen capable of microcephaly and sexual transmission remains unanswered. The unexpected emergence of ZIKV's pathogenicity and capacity for sexual transmission may be due to genetic changes, and future changes in phenotype may continue to occur as the virus expands its geographic range. Alternatively, the sheer size of the 2015-16 epidemic may have brought attention to a pre-existing virulent ZIKV phenotype in a highly susceptible population. Thus, it is important to identify patterns of genetic change that may yield a better understanding of ZIKV emergence and evolution. However, because ZIKV has an RNA genome and a polymerase incapable of proofreading, it undergoes rapid mutation which makes it difficult to identify combinations of mutations associated with viral emergence. As next generation sequencing technology has allowed whole genome consensus and variant sequence data to be generated for numerous virus samples, the task of analyzing these genomes for patterns of mutation has become more complex. However, understanding which combinations of mutations spread widely and become established in new geographic regions versus those that disappear relatively quickly is essential for defining the trajectory of an ongoing epidemic. In this study, multiscale analysis of the wealth of genomic data generated over the course of the epidemic combined with in vivo laboratory data allowed trends in mutations and outbreak trajectory to be assessed. Mutations were detected throughout the genome via deep sequencing, and many variants appeared in multiple samples and in some cases become consensus. Similarly, amino acids that were previously consensus in pre-outbreak samples were detected as low frequency variants in epidemic strains. Protein structural models indicate that most of the mutations associated with the epidemic transmission occur on the exposed surface of viral proteins. At the macroscale level, consensus data was organized into large and interactive databases to allow the spread of individual mutations and combinations of mutations to be visualized and assessed for temporal and geographical patterns. Thus, the use of multiscale modeling for identifying mutations or combinations of mutations that impact epidemic transmission and phenotypic impact can aid the formation of hypotheses which can then be tested using reverse genetics.",2019,,PLOS ONE,14,12,,WOS:000534016700007,10.1371/journal.pone.0225699,,#7221,Borucki 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-23 00:57:47)(Select): no mutation or substitution rates; ,

While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016-2017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was.MethodsTo improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers.Results2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met the eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R-0 (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barre Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%), and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%), and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies.ConclusionsMany ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016-2017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.",2019,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,13,10,,WOS:000494982700003,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007451,,#7233,Kobres 2019,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
The frequency and clinical presentation of Zika virus coinfections: a systematic review,"Lobkowicz, L; Ramond, A; Clemente, NS; Ximenes, RAD; Miranda, DD; Montarroyos, UR; Martelli, CMT; de Araújo, TVB; Brickley, EB","Background There is limited knowledge on the influence of concurrent coinfections on the clinical presentation of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease.Methods To better understand the types, frequencies and clinical manifestations of ZIKV coinfections, we did a systematic review of four databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, LILACS) without restrictions for studies on ZIKV coinfections confirmed by nucleic acid (quantitative real-time-PCR) testing of ZIKV and coinfecting pathogens. The review aimed to identify cohort, cross-sectional, case series and case report studies that described frequencies and/or clinical signs and symptoms of ZIKV coinfections. Conference abstracts, reviews, commentaries and studies with imprecise pathogen diagnoses and/or no clinical evaluations were excluded.Results The search identified 34 articles from 10 countries, comprising 2 cohort, 10 cross-sectional, 8 case series and 14 case report studies. Coinfections were most frequently reported to have occurred with other arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses); out of the 213 coinfections described, ZIKV infections co-occurred with chikungunya in 115 cases, with dengue in 68 cases and with both viruses in 19 cases. Other coinfecting agents included human immunodeficiency, Epstein-Barr, human herpes and Mayaro viruses,Leptospiraspp,Toxoplasma gondiiandSchistosoma mansoni. ZIKV-coinfected cases primarily presented with mild clinical features, typical of ZIKV monoinfection; however, 9% of cases in cohort and cross-sectional studies were reported to experience complications.Conclusion Based on the evidence collated in this review, coinfections do not appear to strongly influence the clinical manifestations of uncomplicated ZIKV infections.

Phylogenetic surveillance of travel-related Zika virus infections through whole-genome sequencing methods,"Kamelian, K; Montoya, V; Olmstead, A; Dong, WN; Harrigan, R; Morshed, M; Joy, JB","In 2018, the World Health Organization identified the Zika virus (ZIKV) as a pathogen that should be prioritized for public health research due to its epidemic potential. In this study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of travel-acquired ZIKV infections was used to examine the limitations of phylogenetic analysis. WGS and phylogenetic analysis were performed to investigate geographic clustering of samples from five Canadians with travel-acquired ZIKV infections and to assess the limitations of phylogenetic analysis of ZIKV sequences using a phylogenetic cluster approach. Genomic variability of ZIKV samples was assessed and for context, compared with hepatitis C virus (HCV) samples. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the suspected region of ZIKV infection for one of five samples and one sample failed to cluster with sequences from its suspected country of infection. Travel-acquired ZIKV samples depicted low genomic variability relative to HCV samples. A floating patristic distance threshold classified all pre-2000 ZIKV sequences into separate clusters, while only Cambodian, Peruvian, Malaysian, and South Korean sequences were similarly classifiable. While phylogenetic analysis of ZIKV data can identify the broad geographical region of ZIKV infection, ZIKV's low genomic variability is likely to limit precise interpretations of phylogenetic analysis of the origins of travel-related cases.",2019,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,9,,,WOS:000495611100025,10.1038/s41598-019-52613-8,,#7268,Kamelian 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

The recent availability of nucleic acid testing (NAT) to screen blood donations on an automated platform provides the opportunity to detect potentially infectious units in asymptomatic donors. Study Design and Methods Three thousand blood donations from Vietnam and 6000 from Thailand were screened with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (cobas CHIKV/DENV, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and equal numbers on cobas Zika (Roche Diagnostics). Reactive samples were tested by alternative NAT with resolution of discordant results by heminested PCR. Throughput of simultaneous testing of the two assays on the cobas 8800 system (Roche Diagnostics) was evaluated. Results In Vietnam, 9 of 3045 samples were reactive for DENV and all were confirmed, for a prevalence (with 95% confidence interval [CI]) of 0.296% (0.135-0.560). In Thailand, 2 of 6000 samples were reactive for CHIKV, 4 of 6000 for DENV, and 1 of 6005 for ZIKV, and all confirmed. The prevalence of CHIKV is 0.033% (0.004-0.120), DENV 0.067% (0.018-0.171), and ZIKV 0.017% (0.000-0.093). The overall specificity for the cobas CHIKV/DENV and cobas Zika tests was 100% (99.959-100). For the simultaneous assay testing, 960 test results were available in 7 hours and 53 minutes.

Climate and vector-borne diseases in Indonesia: a systematic literature review and critical appraisal of evidence,"Marina, R; Ariati, J; Anwar, A; Astuti, EP; Dhewantara, PW","Climate is widely known as an important driver to transmit vector-borne diseases (VBD). However, evidence of the role of climate variability on VBD risk in Indonesia has not been adequately understood. We conducted a systematic literature review to collate and critically review studies on the relationship between climate variability and VBD in Indonesia. We searched articles on PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases that are published until December 2021. Studies that reported the relationship of climate and VBD, such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and malaria, were included. For the reporting, we followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A total of 66 out of 284 studies were reviewed. Fifty-two (78.8%) papers investigated dengue, 13 (19.7%) papers studied malaria, one (1.5%) paper discussed chikungunya, and no (0%) paper reported on Zika. The studies were predominantly conducted in western Indonesian cities. Most studies have examined the short-term effect of climate variability on the incidence of VBD at national, sub-national, and local levels. Rainfall (n = 60/66; 90.9%), mean temperature (T-mean) (n = 50/66; 75.8%), and relative humidity (RH) (n = 50/66; 75.8%) were the common climatic factors employed in the studies. The effect of climate on the incidence of VBD was heterogenous across locations. Only a few studies have investigated the long-term effects of climate on the distribution and incidence of VBD. The paucity of high-quality epidemiological data and variation in methodology are two major issues that limit the generalizability of evidence.

We systemically reviewed the literature to understand clinical manifestations and health outcomes in adults globally. Methods This review was registered prospectively with PROPSERO (CRD 42018096558). We systematically searched for studies in six databases from inception to the end of September 2020. There were no language restrictions. Critical appraisal was completed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. Findings We identified 73 studies globally that reported clinical outcomes in ZIKV-infected adults, of which 55 studies were from the Americas. For further analysis, we considered studies that met 70% of critical appraisal criteria and described subjects with confirmed ZIKV. The most common symptoms included: exanthema (5,456/6,129; 89%), arthralgia (3,809/6,093; 63%), fever (3,787/6,124; 62%), conjunctivitis (2,738/3,283; 45%), myalgia (2,498/5,192; 48%), headache (2,165/4,722; 46%), and diarrhea (337/2,622; 13%). 36/14,335 (0.3%) of infected cases developed neurologic sequelae, of which 75% were Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). Most subjects reported recovery from peak of neurological complications, though a small proportion endured chronic disability. Mortality was rare (0.1%) and hospitalization (11%) was often associated with co-morbidities or GBS. Conclusions The ZIKV literature in adults was predominantly from the Americas. The most common systemic symptoms were exanthema, fever, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis; GBS was the most prevalent neurological complication. Future ZIKV studies are warranted with standardization of testing and case definitions, consistent co-infection testing, reporting of laboratory abnormalities, separation of adult and pediatric outcomes, and assessing for causation between ZIKV and neurological sequelae.Author summary Interest in Zika virus (ZIKV) has increased in the last decade due to its emergence and rapid spread in the Americas. In this review, we examine ZIKV clinical manifestations and sequelae in adults. Among studies reporting subjects with confirmed ZIKV and critical appraisal scores of at least 70%, symptoms reported include exanthema, fever, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, myalgia, headache, and diarrhea. Neurological sequelae in this group occurred in 0.3% of subjects, of which 75% were Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). Recovery from GBS was variable: some patients returned to health and others endured chronic disability. Mortality was rare (0.1%). Hospitalization (11%) was often associated co-morbidities or GBS; this percentage perhaps reflects studies in which all reported subjects were hospitalized. Synthesizing reported data is challenging given the wide range of case definitions and ZIKV testing practices.",2021,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,15,7,,WOS:000674292500003,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009516,,#7333,Halani 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

In this study, we quantified the abundance of Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti and the local transmission potential for three arboviral infections at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution in areas where no entomological surveillance is available. Methods We developed a computational model to quantify the daily abundance of Aedes mosquitoes, leveraging temperature and precipitation records. The model was calibrated on mosquito surveillance data collected in 115 locations in Europe and the Americas between 2007 and 2018. Model estimates were used to quantify the reproduction number of dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya in Europe and the Americas, at a high spatial resolution. Findings In areas colonised by both Aedes species, A aegypti was estimated to be the main vector for the transmission of dengue virus, Zika virus, and chikungunya, being associated with a higher estimate of R0 when compared with Aalbopictus. Our estimates highlighted that these arboviruses were endemic in tropical and subtropical countries, with the highest risks of transmission found in central America, Venezuela, Colombia, and central-east Brazil. A non-negligible potential risk of transmission was also estimated for Florida, Texas, and Arizona (USA). The broader ecological niche of A albopictus could contribute to the emergence of chikungunya outbreaks and clusters of dengue autochthonous cases in temperate areas of the Americas, as well as in mediterranean Europe (in particular, in Italy, southern France, and Spain). Interpretation Our results provide a comprehensive overview of the transmission potential of arboviral diseases in Europe and the Americas, highlighting areas where surveillance and mosquito control capacities should be prioritised.

Interactions between seasonal temperature variation and temporal synchrony drive increased arbovirus co-infection incidence,"Poterek, ML; Vogels, CBF; Grubaugh, ND; Ebel, GD; Perkins, TA; Cavany, SM","Though instances of arthropod-borne (arbo)virus co-infection have been documented clinically, the overall incidence of arbovirus co-infection and its drivers are not well understood. Now that dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses are all in circulation across tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it is important to understand the environmental and biological conditions that make co-infections more likely to occur. To understand this, we developed a mathematical model of co-circulation of two arboviruses, with transmission parameters approximating dengue, Zika and/or chikungunya viruses, and co-infection possible in both humans and mosquitoes. We examined the influence of seasonal timing of arbovirus co-circulation on the extent of co-infection. By undertaking a sensitivity analysis of this model, we examined how biological factors interact with seasonality to determine arbovirus co-infection transmission and prevalence. We found that temporal synchrony of the co-infecting viruses and average temperature were the most influential drivers of co-infection incidence. Our model highlights the synergistic effect of co-transmission from mosquitoes, which leads to more than double the number of co-infections than would be expected in a scenario without co-transmission. Our results suggest that appreciable numbers of co-infections are unlikely to occur except in tropical climates when the viruses co-occur in time and space.",2022,,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,9,10,,WOS:000873964200007,10.1098/rsos.220829,,#7369,Poterek 2022,Exclusion reason: Co-infection study; Extractor (2024-08-21 22:54:53)(Select): model; ,
Forecasting new diseases in low-data settings using transfer learning,"Roster, K; Connaughton, C; Rodrigues, FA","Recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Zika epidemic in Brazil, have dem-onstrated both the importance and difficulty of accurately forecasting novel infectious diseases. When new dis-eases first emerge, we have little knowledge of the transmission process, the level and duration of immunity to reinfection, or other parameters required to build realistic epidemiological models. Time series forecasts and ma-chine learning, while less reliant on assumptions about the disease, require large amounts of data that are also not available in early stages of an outbreak. In this study, we examine how knowledge of related diseases can help make predictions of new diseases in data-scarce environments using transfer learning. We implement both an empirical and a synthetic approach. Using data from Brazil, we compare how well different machine learning models transfer knowledge between two different dataset pairs: case counts of (i) dengue and Zika, and (ii) in-fluenza and COVID-19. In the synthetic analysis, we generate data with an SIR model using different transmission and recovery rates, and then compare the effectiveness of different transfer learning methods. We find that trans-fer learning offers the potential to improve predictions, even beyond a model based on data from the target dis-ease, though the appropriate source disease must be chosen carefully. While imperfect, these models offer an additional input for decision makers for pandemic response.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

In the absence of a ZIKV vaccine or prophylactics, principal investigators (PIs) and international leaders in ZIKV research have formed the ZIKV Individual Participant Data (IPD) Consortium to identify, collect and synthesise IPD from longitudinal studies of pregnant women that measure ZIKV infection during pregnancy and fetal, infant or child outcomes.Methods and analysis We will identify eligible studies through the ZIKV IPD Consortium membership and a systematic review and invite study Pls to participate in the IPD meta-analysis (IPD-MA). We will use the combined dataset to estimate the relative and absolute risk of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), including microcephaly and late symptomatic congenital infections; identify and explore sources of heterogeneity in those estimates and develop and validate a risk prediction model to identify the pregnancies at the highest risk of CZS or adverse developmental outcomes. The variable accuracy of diagnostic assays and differences in exposure and outcome definitions means that included studies will have a higher level of systematic variability, a component of measurement error, than an IPD-MA of studies of an established pathogen. We will use expert testimony, existing internal and external diagnostic accuracy validation studies and laboratory external quality assessments to inform the distribution of measurement error in our models. We will apply both Bayesian and frequentist methods to directly account for these and other sources of uncertainty.Ethics and dissemination The IPD-MA was deemed exempt from ethical review.

Of greatest concern were complications following acute infection during pregnancy. At the beginning of the outbreak, the risk to unborn babies and their clinical presentation was unclear. This report describes the methods and results of the UK surveillance response to assess the risk of ZIKV to children born to returning travellers. Established surveillance systems operating within the UK - the paediatric and obstetric surveillance units for rare diseases, and national laboratory monitoring - enabled rapid assessment of this emerging public health threat. A combined total of 11 women experiencing adverse pregnancy outcomes after possible ZIKV exposure were reported by the three surveillance systems; five miscarriages, two intrauterine deaths and four children with clinical presentations potentially associated with ZIKV infection. Sixteen women were diagnosed with ZIKV during pregnancy in the UK. Amongst the offspring of these women, there was unequivocal laboratory evidence of infection in only one child.

Predicting Transmission Suitability of Mosquito-Borne Diseases under Climate Change to Underpin Decision Making,"Sargent, K; Mollard, J; Henley, SF; Bollasina, MA","The risk of the mosquito-borne diseases malaria, dengue fever and Zika virus is expected to shift both temporally and spatially under climate change. As climate change projections continue to improve, our ability to predict these shifts is also enhanced. This paper predicts transmission suitability for these mosquito-borne diseases, which are three of the most significant, using the most up-to-date climate change projections. Using a mechanistic methodology, areas that are newly suitable and those where people are most at risk of transmission under the best- and worst-case climate change scenarios have been identified. The results show that although transmission suitability is expected to decrease overall for malaria, some areas will become newly suitable, putting naive populations at risk. In contrast, transmission suitability for dengue fever and Zika virus is expected to increase both in duration and geographical extent. Although transmission suitability is expected to increase in temperate zones for a few months of the year, suitability remains focused in the tropics. The highest transmission suitability in tropical regions is likely to exacerbate the intense existing vulnerability of these populations, especially children, to the multiple consequences of climate change, and their severe lack of resources and agency to cope with these impacts and pressures. As these changes in transmission suitability are amplified under the worst-case climate change scenario, this paper makes the case in support of enhanced and more urgent efforts to mitigate climate change than has been achieved to date. By presenting consistent data on the climate-driven spread of multiple mosquito-borne diseases, our work provides more holistic information to underpin prevention and control planning and decision making at national and regional levels.",2022,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,19,20,,WOS:000873337000001,10.3390/ijerph192013656,,#7433,Sargent 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Heart Disease and Arboviruses: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Nicacio, JM; Gomes, OV; do Carmo, RF; Nunes, SLP; Rocha, JRCF; de Souza, CDF; Franca, RFD; Khouri, R; Barral-Netto, M; Armstrong, AD","Dengue fever, chikungunya, and zika are highly prevalent arboviruses transmitted by hematophagous arthropods, with a widely neglected impact in developing countries. These diseases cause acute illness in diverse populations, as well as potential cardiovascular complications. A systematic review was carried out to investigate the burden of cardiac involvement related to these arboviruses. Multiple databases were searched for articles that investigated the association of cardiovascular diseases with arboviruses, published up to March 2022. Relevant articles were selected and rated by two independent reviewers. Proportion meta-analysis was applied to assess the frequency-weighted mean of the cardiovascular findings. A total of 42 articles were selected (n = 76,678 individuals), with 17 manuscripts on dengue and 6 manuscripts on chikungunya undergoing meta-analysis. The global pooled incidence of cardiac events in dengue fever using a meta-analysis was 27.21% (95% CI 20.21-34.83; I-2 = 94%). The higher incidence of dengue-related myocarditis was found in the population younger than 20 years old (33.85%; 95% CI 0.00-89.20; I-2 = 99%). Considering the studies on chikungunya (n = 372), the global pooled incidence of cardiac involvement using a meta-analysis was 32.81% (95% CI 09.58-61.49, I-2 = 96%).

Several ZIKV sequences from clinical cases have been reported, but none from asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic infections. We isolated and sequenced ZIKV from asymptomatic/presymptomatic blood donor (ABD-ZIKV) samples and compared with reported clinical sequences. Twelve ABD-ZIKV isolates were produced from 67 cultivated samples, and isolates were genetically similar among themselves. Most isolates shared mutations with the clinical isolate PRVABC59 2015, whereas two ABD-ZIKV isolates shared specific mutations with U.S. clinical isolates from 2016.

Efforts were made to implement genomic surveillance of ZIKV as part of the public health responses. The accuracy of spatiotemporal reconstructions of the epidemic spread relies on the unbiased sampling of the transmission process. In the early stages of the outbreak, we recruited patients exhibiting clinical symptoms of arbovirus-like infection from Salvador and Campo Formoso, Bahia, in Northeast Brazil. Between May 2015 and June 2016, we identified 21 cases of acute ZIKV infection and subsequently recovered 14 near full-length sequences using the amplicon tiling multiplex approach with nanopore sequencing. We performed a time-calibrated discrete phylogeographic analysis to trace the spread and migration history of the ZIKV. Our phylogenetic analysis supports a consistent relationship between ZIKV migration from Northeast to Southeast Brazil and its subsequent dissemination beyond Brazil. Additionally, our analysis provides insights into the migration of ZIKV from Brazil to Haiti and the role Brazil played in the spread of ZIKV to other countries, such as Singapore, the USA, and the Dominican Republic.

Acute Zika virus infection in an asymptomatic blood donor at the onset of the Puerto Rico epidemic,"Saa, P; Chiu, C; Grimm, K; Yu, GX; Benjamin, RJ; Corash, L; Stramer, SL","BACKGROUND Zika virus (ZIKV) spread to Puerto Rico likely originated from southeastern Brazil approximately 8.5 months earlier than blood donation screening for ZIKV was initiated, but the time of ZIKV introduction in the blood donor population remains unknown. METHODS To better understand when arboviral infections first appeared in the blood donor pool in Puerto Rico, we retrospectively screened for ZIKV RNA (as well as chikungunya [CHIKV] and dengue [DENV] viral RNA) a repository of 1186 linked blood donor and recipient samples collected from February 2015 to May 2016 as an endpoint efficacy measure following the introduction of platelet pathogen reduction (PR). Phylogenetic analysis identified relatedness of donor strain to other circulating strains, and molecular clock analysis identified the estimated time of introduction. RESULTS An asymptomatic donor collected in December 2015 was ZIKV RNA confirmed positive, 4 months BEFORE investigational nucleic acid testing (NAT) implementation in April 2016, coincident and related to the first reported autochthonous cases. No CHIKV RNA or DENV RNA reactives were identified in donors or recipients, and no adverse events were reported from PR use in recipients. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the molecular relatedness of the donor ZIKV strain to the Puerto Rico lineage likely introduced approximately 4.5 months earlier. CONCLUSION This study identified an asymptomatic ZIKV infection in a blood donor occurring before those previously recognized by blood donation screening.

"Survival analysis in non-congenital neurological disorders related to dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus infections in Northeast Brazil","de Lima, ECB; Montarroyos, UR; de Magalhaes, JF; Dimech, GS; Lacerda, HR","The Northeast of Brazil has experienced a triple epidemic, with the simultaneous circulation of dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), which may have contributed to the observed increase across this region of atypical forms of disease and deaths. In view of this fact, non-congenital neurological disorders related to arboviruses were compared with other etiologies, mortality and survival rates of patients admitted to referral neurology hospitals in Pernambuco State, Northeast Brazil, from 2015 to 2018. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected and tested using molecular and serological assays. The arbovirus-exposed groups were compared with respect to epidemiological, clinical and neurologic characteristics by using the Pearson's chi-square test. For the survival analysis, the Kaplan-Meier and Hazard Ratio (HR) tests were used, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Encephalitis and encephalomyelitis were more frequent in arboviruses, while myelitis predominated in the neurological disorders of other etiologies. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) was similarly distributed amongst the groups. Exposure to one of the arboviruses caused a six-fold increase in the risk of death (HR: 6.37; CI: 2.91 - 13.9). Amongst the arbovirus-exposed groups, infection (DENV/CHIKV) increased nine times the risk of death (HR: 9.07; CI: 3.67 - 22.4). The survival curve indicates that have been exposed to some arbovirus decreased the likelihood of survival compared to those with other etiologies (Log-Rank: p<0.001).

Several arbovirus infections have been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). We investigated whether arboviruses are driving GBS beyond epidemic phases of transmission and studied the antibody response to glycolipids. The protocol of the International Guillain-Barre syndrome Outcome Study (IGOS), an observational prospective cohort study, was adapted to a case-control design. Serum samples were tested for a recent infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV) virus, hepatitis E virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Campylobacter jejuni, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and for antibodies to glycolipids. Forty-nine patients were included from Brazil (63%), Argentina (14%), and Malaysia (22%).

In 22 patients, 35 paired controls were collected. Odds ratio for recent infections did not significantly differ between cases and controls. No typical anti-ganglioside antibody binding was associated with recent arbovirus infection. We conclude that arbovirus infections occur in GBS patients outside of epidemic viral transmission, although not significantly more than in controls.

Guillain-Barre syndrome related to Zika virus infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical and electrophysiological phenotype,"Leonhard, SE; Bresani-Salvi, CC; Batista, JDL; Cunha, S; Jacobs, BC; Ferreira, MLB; de Albuquerque, MDPM","BackgroundThe Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in epidemiological studies. Whether ZIKV-associated GBS is related to a specific clinical or electrophysiological phenotype has not been established. To this end, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies on ZIKV-related GBS.MethodsWe searched Pubmed, EMBASE and LILACS, and included all papers, reports or bulletins with full text in English, Spanish or Portuguese, reporting original data of patients with GBS and a suspected, probable or confirmed recent ZIKV infection. Data were extracted according to a predefined protocol, and pooled proportions were calculated.ResultsThirty-five studies were included (13 single case reports and 22 case series, case-control or cohort studies), reporting on a total of 601 GBS patients with a suspected, probable or confirmed ZIKV infection. Data from 21 studies and 587 cases were available to be summarized. ZIKV infection was confirmed in 21%, probable in 22% and suspected in 57% of cases. ZIKV PCR was positive in 30% (95%CI 15-47) of tested patients. The most common clinical features were: limb weakness 97% (95%CI 93-99), diminished/absent reflexes 96% (95%CI 88-100), sensory symptoms 82% (95%CI 76-88), and facial palsy 51% (95%CI 44-58). Median time between infectious and neurological symptoms was 5-12 days. Most cases had a demyelinating electrophysiological subtype and half of cases were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Heterogeneity between studies was moderate to substantial for most variables.ConclusionsThe clinical phenotype of GBS associated with ZIKV infection reported in literature is generally a sensorimotor demyelinating GBS with frequent facial palsy and a severe disease course often necessitating ICU admittance. Time between infectious and neurological symptoms and negative PCR in most cases suggests a post-infectious disease mechanism.

"Inverse association between dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus infection and indicators of household air pollution in Santa Rosa, Guatemala: A case-control study, 2011-2018","Madewell, ZJ; López, MR; Espinosa-Bode, A; Brouwer, KC; Sánchez, CG; McCracken, JP","Background Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses are increasingly important public health problems. Burning vegetation, leaves, and other plant products have been shown to be effective mosquito repellents for their vector,Aedes spp., but there has been scant research on whether firewood cooking smoke in households influences mosquito populations or mosquito-borne diseases. About 2.9 billion people worldwide use biomass fuel for household cooking and heating, resulting in an estimated 1.6 million deaths annually from household air pollution (HAP)-related diseases. Global health agencies now encourage households to transition from biomass to clean fuels, but it is unclear whether such interventions may actually increase risk for mosquito-borne diseases. This retrospective case-control study evaluated associations between arboviral infections and cooking with firewood in Santa Rosa, Guatemala. Method Vigilancia Integrada Comunitaria(VICo) was a prospective public health surveillance system for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of diarrheal, neurological, respiratory, and febrile illnesses in hospitals and clinics in the department of Santa Rosa, Guatemala. Enrolled VICo in-patients and out-patients during 2011-2018 were interviewed using standardized questionnaires on demographics and household characteristics. Blood and stool specimens were collected and tested to identify the etiologies presenting symptoms. Cases were defined as laboratory-positive for dengue, chikungunya, or Zika virus infections. Controls were laboratory-positive for bacterial and viral diarrheal illnesses (e.g.,Salmonella,Shigella,Campylobacter,Escherichia coli, rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, or astrovirus). Cooking with firewood, kitchen location, stove type, and firewood cooking frequency were the independent exposure variables. Logistic regression models were used to analyze unadjusted and adjusted associations between arboviral infections and exposures of interest. Result There were 311 arboviral cases and 1,239 diarrheal controls. Arboviral infections were inversely associated with cooking with firewood in the main house (AOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.08-0.57), cooking with firewood on an open hearth (AOR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.33-0.78), and cooking with firewood >= 5 times per week (AOR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36-0.81), adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status index, number of people per household, community population density, community elevation, recruitment location, season, and admission year. Conclusion Several primary determinants of HAP exposure were inversely associated with arboviral infections. Additional studies are needed to understand whether interventions to reduce HAP might actually increase risk for mosquito-borne infectious diseases, which would warrant improved education and mosquito control efforts in conjunction with fuel interventions.",2020,,PLOS ONE,15,6,,WOS:000543261600013,10.1371/journal.pone.0234399,,#7490,Madewell 2020,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,

The highest burden of this outbreak was in northeast Brazil, including the state of Pernambuco. The prevalence of congenital microcephaly in Pernambuco state was estimated from the RESP (Registro de Eventos em Saude Publica) surveillance system, from August 2015 to August 2016 inclusive. The denominators were estimated at the municipality level from official demographic data. Microcephaly was defined as a neonatal head circumference below the 3rd percentile of the Intergrowth standards. Smoothed maps of the prevalence of microcephaly were obtained from a Bayesian model which was conditional autoregressive (CAR) in space, and first order autoregressive in time. A total of 742 cases were identified. Additionally, high and early occurrences were identified in the Recife Metropolitan Region, on the coast, and in a north-south band about 300 km inland. Over a substantial part of the state, the overall prevalence, aggregating over the study period, was above 0.5%.

Surveillance systems are vital components of disease control programs to understand disease burden, trends, and to detect outbreaks. However, underreporting can bias estimates and greatly reduce surveillance data utility. We used a capture-recapture analysis to identify cases that were diagnosed at the healthcare facilities (capture) and those that were reported to SIVIGILA (recapture) in order to assess the degree of overlapping between diagnosis and reporting. Our study was conducted in three different endemicity settings and showed that the overall reporting of arboviruses was variable in magnitude and dependent on several factors including age of the case, year of diagnosis, and type of health care provider. We also identify the need to correct for misclassification when estimating arboviral burden based on clinical diagnosis in endemic settings using data from passive surveillance systems.BackgroundChikungunya, dengue, and Zika are three different arboviruses which have similar symptoms and are a major public health issue in Colombia. Despite the mandatory reporting of these arboviruses to the National Surveillance System in Colombia (SIVIGILA), it has been reported that the system captures less than 10% of diagnosed cases in some cities.Methodology/Principal findingsTo assess the scope and degree of arboviruses reporting in Colombia between 2014-2017, we conducted an observational study of surveillance data using the capture-recapture approach in three Colombian cities. Using healthcare facility registries (capture data) and surveillance-notified cases (recapture data), we estimated the degree of reporting by clinical diagnosis. We fit robust Poisson regressions to identify predictors of reporting and estimated the predicted probability of reporting by disease and year. To account for the potential misclassification of the clinical diagnosis, we used the simulation extrapolation for misclassification (MC-SIMEX) method. A total of 266,549 registries were examined. Overall arboviruses' reporting ranged from 5.3% to 14.7% and varied in magnitude according to age and year of diagnosis. Dengue was the most notified disease (21-70%) followed by Zika (6-45%). The highest reporting rate was seen in 2016, an epidemic year. The MC-SIMEX corrected rates indicated underestimation of the reporting due to the potential misclassification bias.ConclusionsThese findings reflect challenges on arboviruses' reporting, and therefore, potential challenges on the estimation of arboviral burden in Colombia and other endemic settings with similar surveillance systems.",2021,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,15,2,,WOS:000616720900001,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009014,,#7502,Carabali 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Among them, any arbovirosis was confirmed in 14 (53.8%): 13 dengue plus 1 chikungunya fever. There were no cases of Zika fever. There was a history of travel to endemic areas 23 (88.4%), but not in 3 cases (11.6%) in which the possibility of an indigenous transmission was considered; of them, a case of dengue was confirmed. The estimated incidence of arbovirosis was 0.4 (95% CI: 0.33-0.51) cases x 10,000 hab/year which, when compared to the estimated incidence in the same geographical area during the period 2009.2013 (0.19 cases x 10,000 hab/year; 95% CI: 0.07-0.31), a significant increase was found (P= .044). Patients within viremia period at the time of their first medical visit were 11 (42.3%).Conclusions: An intensified epidemiological surveillance program defined at Primary Care and hospital levels is able to detect significantly more cases of imported and autochthonous arbovirosis. Possibly we are witnessing an increase in the incidence of imported arbovirosis and, thus, measures aimed at their identification and confirmation should be reinforced. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Across Pacific Island countries and areas (PICs), outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are increasing in frequency and scale. Data about arbovirus outbreaks are incomplete, with reports sporadic, delayed, and often based solely on syndromic surveillance. We undertook a systematic review of published and grey literature and contacted relevant regional authorities to collect information about arboviral activity affecting PICs between October 2014 and June 2020. Our literature search identified 1176 unique peer-reviewed articles that were reduced to 25 relevant publications when screened. Our grey literature search identified 873 sources. Collectively, these data reported 104 unique outbreaks, including 72 dengue outbreaks affecting 19 (out of 22) PICs, 14 chikungunya outbreaks affecting 11 PICs, and 18 Zika outbreaks affecting 14 PICs. Our review is the most complete account of arboviral outbreaks to affect PICs since comparable work was published in 2014. It highlights the continued elevated level of arboviral activity across the Pacific and inconsistencies in how information about outbreaks is reported and recorded. It demonstrates the importance of a One-Health approach and the role that improved communication and reporting between different governments and sectors play in understanding the emergence, circulation, and transboundary risks posed by arboviral diseases.",2022,,PATHOGENS,11,1,,WOS:000747059500001,10.3390/pathogens11010074,,#7529,Matthews 2022,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Heterogeneity in network structure switches the dominant transmission mode of infectious diseases,"Kollepara, PK; Chisholm, RH; Miller, JC","Several recent emerging diseases have exhibited both sexual and nonsexual transmission modes (Ebola, Zika, and mpox). In the recent mpox outbreaks, transmission through sexual contacts appears to be the dominant mode of transmission. Motivated by this, we use an SIR-like model to argue that an initially dominant sexual transmission mode can be overtaken by casual transmission at later stages, even if the basic casual reproduction number is less than one.

This study used data from ReLAMC registries to quantify the prevalence of microcephaly from 2010 to 2017 (before, during and after the Zika virus epidemic). Design Nine ReLAMC congenital anomaly registries provided case-level data or aggregate data for any live births, still births or terminations of pregnancy with microcephaly. Births to pregnant women infected with Zika virus first occurred in Brazil in 2015, and in the remaining registry areas in 2016 with the exception of Chile that did not experience Zika virus. Therefore the prevalence of microcephaly for 2010-2014 and individual years 2015, 2016 and 2017 was estimated using multilevel random effect Poisson models. Clinical classification and characteristics of the cases were compared pre and post Zika for all centres providing individual case-level data.

Emerging or reemerging diseases are those that (re)occur in regions, groups or hosts that were previously free from these diseases: dengue virus; chikungunya virus; Zika virus; West Nile fever and malaria. In Europe, these infections are mostly imported; however, due to the presence of competent mosquitoes and the number of trips both to and from endemic areas, these pathogens are potentially emergent or re-emergent. Present and future climatic conditions, as well as meteorological, environmental and demographic aspects are risk factors for the distribution of different vectors and/or diseases. This review aimed to identify and analyze the existing literature on the transmission of mosquito borne diseases and those factors potentially affecting their transmission risk of them in six southern European countries with similar environmental conditions: Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In addition, we would identify those factors potentially affecting the (re)introduction or spread of mosquito vectors. This task has been undertaken with a focus on the environmental and climatic factors, including the effects of climate change. We undertook a systematic review of the vectors, diseases and their associations with climactic and environmental factors in European countries of the Mediterranean region. We followed the PRISMA guidelines and used explicit and systematic methods to identify, select and critically evaluate the studies which were relevant to the topic. We identified 1302 articles in the first search of the databases. Of those, 160 were selected for full-text review. The final data set included 61 articles published between 2000 and 2017.39.3% of the papers were related with dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus or their vectors. Temperature, precipitation and population density were key factors among others. 32.8% studied West Nile virus and its vectors, being temperature, precipitation and NDVI the most frequently used variables. Malaria have been studied in 23% of the articles, with temperature, precipitation and presence of water indexes as the most used variables. The number of publications focused on mosquito borne diseases is increasing in recent years, reflecting the increased interest in that diseases in southern European countries. Climatic and environmental variables are key factors on mosquitoes' distribution and to show the risk of emergence and/or spread of emergent diseases and to study the spatial changes in that distributions.",2020,,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,191,,,WOS:000587971600029,10.1016/j.envres.2020.110038,,#7575,Brugueras 2020,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

Enhanced surveillance of GBS in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) following the 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic presents an opportunity to estimate, for the first time, the regional incidence of GBS.Methods and findingsFor this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched nine scientific databases and grey literature from January 1, 1980 to October 1, 2018. Sources with primary data on incident GBS cases in LAC within a well-defined population and timeframe, published in English, Spanish, Portuguese, or French, were included. We calculated the annual GBS incidence rates (IRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each source based on published data. Following an assessment of heterogeneity, we used random-effects meta-analysis to calculate the pooled annual IR of GBS. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018086659. Of the 6568 initial citation hits, 31 were eligible for inclusion. Background annual GBS IRs in Latin America ranged from 0.40 in Brazil to 2.12/100,000 in Chile. The pooled annual IR in the Caribbean was 1.64 (95% CI 1.29-2.12, I-2<0.01, p = 0.44). During the ZIKV epidemic, GBS IRs ranged from 0.62 in Mexico to 9.35/100,000 in Martinique. GBS increased 2.6 (95% CI 2.3-2.9) times during ZIKV and 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.4) times during chikungunya outbreaks over background rates. A limitation of this review is that the studies included employed different methodologies to find and ascertain cases of GBS, which could contribute to IR heterogeneity. In addition, it is important to consider that data on GBS are lacking for many countries in the region.ConclusionsBackground IRs of GBS appear to peak during arboviral disease outbreaks.

These diseases present a significant incidence within the human settlements increasing morbidity and mortality events. Likewise, among the different genus of mosquito vectors of arboviruses, those of the most significant medical importance corresponds to Aedes and Culex. In Latin America, the mosquito vector species of YFV, DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV are mainly Aedes aegypti and Ae. Albopictus. Ae. aegypti is recognized as the primary vector in urban environments, whereas Ae. albopictus, recently introduced in the Americas, is more prone to rural settings.

To determine the immunity landscape of these viruses, seroprevalence studies are often performed using IgG ELISA, which is a simple and rapid alternative to the virus neutralization test. In this review, we aim to describe the trends in flavivirus IgG ELISA-based serosurveys. A systematic literature review using six databases was performed to collate cohort and cross-sectional studies performed on the general population. A total of 204 studies were included in this review. The results show that most studies were performed on dengue virus (DENV), whereas Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) was the least studied. For geographic distribution, serosurveys followed known disease prevalence. Temporally, the number of serosurveys increased after outbreaks and epidemics except for JEV, for which studies were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. Commercial kits were more commonly used than in-house assays for DENV, West Nile Virus (WNV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Overall, most studies employed an indirect ELISA format, and the choice of antigens varied per virus. This review shows that flavivirus epidemiology is related to the regional and temporal distribution of serosurveys.

In this study, we used multiplex amplicon sequencing on the Illumina Miseq instrument to describe ZIKV WGS. Six ZIKV WGS were derived from three samples of field-caught Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes (two males and one female) and three urine samples collected from patients in three different provinces of Thailand. Additionally, successful isolation of a ZIKV isolate occurred from a female Cx. quinquefasciatus. The WGS analysis revealed a correlation between the 2020 outbreak and the acquisition of five amino acid changes in the Asian lineage ZIKV strains from Thailand (2006), Cambodia (2010 and 2019), and the Philippines (2012). These changes, including C-T106A, prM-V1A, E-V473M, NS1-A188V, and NS5-M872V, were identified in all seven WGS, previously linked to significantly higher mortality rates. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the seven ZIKV sequences belonged to the Asian lineage. Notably, the genomic region of the E gene showed the highest nucleotide diversity (0.7-1.3%). This data holds significance in informing the development of molecular tools that enhance our understanding of virus patterns and evolution. Moreover, it may identify targets for improved methods to prevent and control future ZIKV outbreaks.",2023,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,13,1,,WOS:001092348300039,10.1038/s41598-023-45814-9,,#7633,Phumee 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
"The triple epidemics of arboviruses in Feira de Santana, Brazilian Northeast: Epidemiological characteristics and diffusion patterns","Skalinski, LM; Dalvi, APR; Natividade, M; Braga, JU; Costa, MDN; Santana, EB; Silva, NSD; Witworth, J; Teixeira, MG","Arboviruses are diseases of worldwide importance in the field of communicable diseases. In Brazil, the ree-mergence of dengue and the emergence of chikungunya and Zika since 2014 have led to epidemic waves of great magnitude and rapid spread. However, their diffusion patterns vary and change over time. This study analyzes the spatial diffusion of the simultaneous circulation of three arboviruses transmitted by the same vector in a large urban space over two epidemic waves in consecutive years. An ecological study of spatial and temporal aggre-gates on the occurrence of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, from 2014 to 2019, in Feira de Santana, Bahia State, was carried out using data of cases reported to the national surveillance system. Four different methods were used to analyze the spatial diffusion: Kernel Estimation with sequential maps, cumulative nearest-neighbor ratios (NNI) over time, spatial correlograms and local autocorrelation changes (LISA) over time. From 2014-2019, there were 21,723 confirmed cases of arboviruses. The highest incidences were among women (496.9, 220.2, and 91.0 cases/100,000 women for dengue, chikungunya and Zika respectively). By age group, the highest in-cidences were from ages 10-19 years old (609.3 dengue cases/100,000), from 60 and more (306.7 chikungunya cases/100,000), and from 0-9 years old (124.1 Zika cases/100,000 inhabitants). The temporal distribution demonstrated two epidemic waves of simultaneous circulation in 2014 and 2015. Kernel maps indicate that arboviruses spread to neighboring areas near the first hotspots, suggesting an expansion diffusion pattern. The NNI, spatial correlograms and LISA changes results suggest expansion patterns for the three arboviruses in all periods. The spatial diffusion pattern of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya in the 2014-2015 epidemics in Feira de Santana was expansion. These findings are useful to guide prevention measures and reduce occurrence in other areas.",2022,,EPIDEMICS,38,,,WOS:000804687300010,10.1016/j.epidem.2022.100541,,#7636,Skalinski 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-29 21:37:47)(Select): extract outbreak from Table 1??; ,
Using simulated infectious disease outbreaks to inform site selection and sample size for individually randomized vaccine trials during an ongoing epidemic,"Madewell, ZJ; Piontti, APY; Zhang, Q; Burton, N; Yang, Y; Longini, IM; Halloran, ME; Vespignani, A; Dean, NE","Background: Novel strategies are needed to make vaccine efficacy trials more robust given uncertain epidemiology of infectious disease outbreaks, such as arboviruses like Zika. Spatially resolved mathematical and statistical models can help investigators identify sites at highest risk of future transmission and prioritize these for inclusion in trials. Models can also characterize uncertainty in whether transmission will occur at a site, and how nearby or connected sites may have correlated outcomes. A structure is needed for how trials can use models to address key design questions, including how to prioritize sites, the optimal number of sites, and how to allocate participants across sites. Methods: We illustrate the added value of models using the motivating example of Zika vaccine trial planning during the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic. We used a stochastic, spatially resolved, transmission model (the Global Epidemic and Mobility model) to simulate epidemics and site-level incidence at 100 high-risk sites in the Americas. We considered several strategies for prioritizing sites (average site-level incidence of infection across epidemics, median incidence, probability of exceeding 1% incidence), selecting the number of sites, and allocating sample size across sites (equal enrollment, proportional to average incidence, proportional to rank). To evaluate each design, we stochastically simulated trials in each hypothetical epidemic by drawing observed cases from site-level incidence data. Results: When constraining overall trial size, the optimal number of sites represents a balance between prioritizing highest-risk sites and having enough sites to reduce the chance of observing too few endpoints. The optimal number of sites remained roughly constant regardless of the targeted number of events, although it is necessary to increase the sample size to achieve the desired power. Though different ranking strategies returned different site orders, they performed similarly with respect to trial power. Instead of enrolling participants equally from each site, investigators can allocate participants proportional to projected incidence, though this did not provide an advantage in our example because the top sites had similar risk profiles. Sites from the same geographic region may have similar outcomes, so optimal combinations of sites may be geographically dispersed, even when these are not the highest ranked sites. Conclusion: Mathematical and statistical models may assist in designing successful vaccination trials by capturing uncertainty and correlation in future transmission. Although many factors affect site selection, such as logistical feasibility, models can help investigators optimize site selection and the number and size of participating sites. Although our study focused on trial design for an emerging arbovirus, a similar approach can be made for any infectious disease with the appropriate model for the particular disease.",2021,,CLINICAL TRIALS,18,5,630-638,WOS:000671413300001,10.1177/17407745211028898,,#7645,Madewell 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-06-17 20:35:55)(Select): transmission model; ,
Direct mosquito feedings on dengue-2 virus-infected people reveal dynamics of human infectiousness,"Lambrechts, L; Reiner, RC; Briesemeister, MV; Barrera, P; Long, KC; Elson, WH; Vizcarra, A; Astete, H; Bazan, I; Siles, C; Vilcarromero, S; Leguia, M; Kawiecki, AB; Perkins, TA; Lloyd, AL; Waller, LA; Kitron, U; Jenkins, SA; Hontz, RD; Campbell, WR; Carrington, LB; Simmons, CP; Ampuero, JS; Vasquez, G; Elder, JP; Paz-Soldan, VA; Vazquez-Prokopec, GM; Rothman, AL; Barker, CM; Scott, TW; Morrison, AC; Viennet, E; Gilbert, AT","Dengue virus (DENV) transmission from humans to mosquitoes is a poorly documented, but critical component of DENV epidemiology. Magnitude of viremia is the primary determinant of successful human-to-mosquito DENV transmission. People with the same level of viremia, however, can vary in their infectiousness to mosquitoes as a function of other factors that remain to be elucidated. Here, we report on a field-based study in the city of Iquitos, Peru, where we conducted direct mosquito feedings on people naturally infected with DENV and that experienced mild illness. We also enrolled people naturally infected with Zika virus (ZIKV) after the introduction of ZIKV in Iquitos during the study period. Of the 54 study participants involved in direct mosquito feedings, 43 were infected with DENV-2, two with DENV-3, and nine with ZIKV. Our analysis excluded participants whose viremia was detectable at enrollment but undetectable at the time of mosquito feeding, which was the case for all participants with DENV-3 and ZIKV infections. We analyzed the probability of onward transmission during 50 feeding events involving 27 participants infected with DENV-2 based on the presence of infectious virus in mosquito saliva 7-16 days post blood meal. Transmission probability was positively associated with the level of viremia and duration of extrinsic incubation in the mosquito. In addition, transmission probability was influenced by the day of illness in a non-monotonic fashion; i.e., transmission probability increased until 2 days after symptom onset and decreased thereafter. We conclude that mildly ill DENV-infected humans with similar levels of viremia during the first two days after symptom onset will be most infectious to mosquitoes on the second day of their illness. Quantifying variation within and between people in their contribution to DENV transmission is essential to better understand the biological determinants of human infectiousness, parametrize epidemiological models, and improve disease surveillance and prevention strategies.In this study, we examined the potential for people with mild illness to transmit dengue virus to mosquitoes. Although people with mild dengue illness can be infectious, they often are undetected by surveillance systems and research teams. Variation in infectiousness over the course of a person's infection is a largely unexplored but potentially important component of dengue epidemiology. In an effort to better understand the factors that underlie this variation, we blood fed laboratory-reared, uninfected mosquitoes directly on mildly ill people naturally infected with dengue virus in Iquitos, Peru. Detection of virus in mosquito saliva after feeding on an infected person was considered positive for mosquito transmission. As has been reported previously, transmission to mosquitoes was positively associated with the amount of virus in a person's blood and the number of days after the mosquito fed on an infected person. Unlike results from previous studies, which reported peak transmission during the first day of a person's illness, we found that for mildly ill people infectiousness to mosquitoes peaked on the second day of illness. Because people with mild illness are thought to contribute more to dengue virus transmission than more severely ill people, subtle differences in the dynamics of their infectiousness to mosquitoes could be epidemiologically significant.",2023,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,17,9,,WOS:001063436200002,10.1371/journal.pntd.0011593,,#7656,Lambrechts 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-21 23:34:00)(Select): EIP; ,

The tropical climate supports the proliferation and establishment of vectors, making it difficult to control transmission. In the last ten years, FG has experienced large outbreaks of imported arboviruses such as Chikungunya and Zika, as well as endemic arboviruses such as dengue, Yellow fever, and Oropouche virus. Epidemiological surveillance is challenging due to the differing distributions and behaviors of vectors. This article aims to summarize the current knowledge of these arboviruses in FG and discuss the challenges of arbovirus emergence and reemergence. Effective control measures are hampered by the nonspecific clinical presentation of these diseases, as well as the Aedes aegypti mosquito's resistance to insecticides. Despite the high seroprevalence of certain viruses, the possibility of new epidemics cannot be ruled out. Therefore, active epidemiological surveillance is needed to identify potential outbreaks, and an adequate sentinel surveillance system and broad virological diagnostic panel are being developed in FG to improve disease management.",2023,,VIRUSES-BASEL,15,6,,WOS:001017854200001,10.3390/v15061268,,#7674,Bonifay 2023,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-03-24 20:41:12)(Screen): review - check if zika-specific parts; ,
"Emerging Infection, Vaccination, and Guillain-Barre Syndrome: A Review","Koike, H; Chiba, A; Katsuno, M","Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system that typically develops within 4 weeks after infection. In addition to conventional infectious diseases with which we are familiar, emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika virus infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have also been suggested to be associated with GBS. GBS is mainly categorized into a demyelinating subtype known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and an axonal subtype known as acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN). Most patients who develop GBS after Zika virus infection or COVID-19 have AIDP. The concept of molecular mimicry between pathogens and human peripheral nerve components was established through studies of AMAN with anti-ganglioside GM1 antibodies occurring after Campylobacter jejuni infection. Although such mimicry between specific pathogens and myelin or Schwann cell components has not been clearly demonstrated in AIDP, a similarity of Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 proteins to human proteins has been suggested. With the development of global commerce and travel, emerging infectious diseases will continue to threaten public health. From this viewpoint, the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs is important to prepare for and control emerging infectious diseases. Although a decrease in the number of patients after the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic increased the difficulty in conducting phase 3 trials for Zika virus vaccines, the efficacy and safety of new vaccines have recently been demonstrated for COVID-19. In general, vaccines can decrease the risk of infectious disease by stimulating the immune system, and discussions regarding an increased risk of autoimmune disorders, such as GBS, have been ongoing for many years. However, the risk of GBS is not considered a legitimate reason to limit the administration of currently available vaccines, as only a trivial association or no association with GBS has been demonstrated.",2021,,NEUROLOGY AND THERAPY,10,2,523-537,WOS:000660841200001,10.1007/s40120-021-00261-4,,#7689,Koike 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-03-23 05:02:37)(Screen): review; ,

Imported cases are characterised and examined to identify trends and features that might assist in reducing transmission risk from travellers. Methods: Information on traveller arrivals, notified cases and risk factors for disease acquisition were obtained from national sources. Trends in importation rates, seasonality are described and relationships of notifications with traveller arrivals were examined with a negative binomial regression model. Results: There was a significant increase in dengue notifications combined with the emergence of Zika and chikungunya. Most notifications were from arrivals in Auckland from Pacific Islands during summer and early autumn. Conclusion/implicOons: Overseas travel from New Zealand, particularly to the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia, involves a risk of arboviral infection. The repeated introduction of arboviruses to New Zealand also increases the risk of local transmission in a country that has vector capable and vector potential mosquitoes, as well as an increasingly suitable climate for new vectors to establish.",2021,,TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE,41,,,WOS:000685447600030,10.1016/j.tmaid.2021.102047,,#7693,Ammar 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

A poisson-multinomial spatial model for simultaneous outbreaks with application to arboviral diseases,"Schmidt, AM; Freitas, LP; Cruz, OG; Carvalho, MS","Dengue, Zika, and chikungunya are arboviral diseases (AVD) transmitted mainly by Aedes aegypti. Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, has been endemic for dengue for over 30 years, and experienced the first joint epidemic of the three diseases between 2015-2016. They present similar symptoms and only a small proportion of cases are laboratory-confirmed. These facts lead to potential misdiagnosis and, consequently, uncertainty in the registration of the cases. We have available the number of cases of each disease for the n = 160 neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro. We propose a Poisson model for the total number of cases of Aedes-borne diseases and, conditioned on the total, we assume a multinomial model for the allocation of the number of cases of each of the diseases across the neighborhoods. This provides simultaneously the estimation of the associations of the relative risk of the total cases of AVD with environmental and socioeconomic variables; and the estimation of the probability of presence of each disease as a function of available covariates. Our findings suggest that a one standard deviation increase in the social development index decreases the relative risk of the total cases of AVD by 28%. Neighborhoods with smaller proportion of green area had greater odds of having chikungunya in comparison to dengue and Zika. A one standard deviation increase in population density decreases the odds of a neighborhood having Zika instead of dengue by 18% but increases the odds of chikungunya in comparison to dengue by 18% and by 43% in comparison to Zika.",2022,,STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH,31,8,1590-1602,WOS:000810335200001,10.1177/09622802221102628,,#7725,Schmidt 2022,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; Extractor (2024-05-29 23:03:35)(Select): grouped all arboviral diseases together; ,

Evaluation of cases followed the guidelines of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Dysmorphological and neurological evaluations were performed by a specialized team, and genetic tests and neuroimaging were performed when clinically indicated. STORCH infections were diagnosed using standard tests. ZIKV infection was diagnosed through maternal serum RT-PCR and/or neuroimaging associated with clinical/epidemiological criteria.Results: From 153 744 registered live births in the study period, 148 cases were notified, but 90 (60.8%) of those were later excluded as ""non-confirmed"" microcephaly. In the 58 confirmed cases of microcephaly (prevalence = 3.8/10 000 live births), congenital infections (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, and ZIKV) constituted the predominant etiology (50.0%), followed by isolated CNS (15.5%), and genetic syndromes (10.3%). Congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS) with typical phenotype was diagnosed in three cases (5.2% of alt confirmed microcephaly cases or 10.4% of all congenital infections).Conclusion: In Rio Grande do Sul, where no outbreak of ZIKV infection was recorded, congenital infections were the leading cause of congenital microcephaly, and the attributable risk for CZS in the etiology of microcephaly was 5.2%.

Transovarial transmission of mosquito-borne viruses: a systematic review,"Janjoter, S; Kataria, D; Yadav, M; Dahiya, N; Sehrawat, N","Background A number of mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs), such as dengue virus (DENV), zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) exert adverse health impacts on the global population. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the prime vectors responsible for the transmission of these viruses. The viruses have acquired a number of routes for successful transmission, including horizontal and vertical transmission. Transovarial transmission is a subset/type of vertical transmission adopted by mosquitoes for the transmission of viruses from females to their offspring through eggs/ovaries. It provides a mechanism for these MBVs to persist and maintain their lineage during adverse climatic conditions of extremely hot and cold temperatures, during the dry season, or in the absence of susceptible vertebrate host when horizontal transmission is not possible.Methods The publications discussed in this systematic review were searched for using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, and websites such as those of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, using the search terms ""transovarial transmission"" and ""mosquito-borne viruses"" from 16 May 2023 to 20 September 2023.Results A total of 2,391 articles were searched, of which 123 were chosen for full text evaluation, and 60 were then included in the study after screening and removing duplicates.Conclusion The present systematic review focuses on understanding the above diseases, their pathogenesis, epidemiology and host-parasite interactions.

To better understand the history and transmission dynamics of ZIKV in Fiji, we combined a transmission dynamic model with serological and surveillance data from Central Division, Fiji. A longitudinal population representative of seroepidemiological data were available from participants sampled in 2013, 2015, and 2017. In addition, ZIKV case reports were available from 2015 and 2016. Using a Bayesian approach, we fitted a transmission dynamic model with a seasonally varying transmission to these data. We also estimated the virus introduction date, given the effect this has on transmission dynamics as it interacts with the observed seasonal pattern of transmission. We found evidence that the virus was introduced in October 2013 (95% credible interval: April 2013–April 2014) and that the strong seasonal transmission pattern meant the virus persisted for several years with multiple waves of infection in consecutive years. It is important to corroborate this evidence against other work done in the same area. A phylogenetic analysis was performed on 5 ZIKV strains obtained from Fiji in 2015 and 2016, which were aligned with 33 E gene sequences from the Pacific, Americas, and Africa. This analysis showed evidence of virus persistence over multiple years in Central Division, Fiji. The estimated most recent common ancestor of the group isolated from Central Division was November 2013 (95% credible interval: March 2013–July 2015). Our modeling estimate is consistent with these results despite the very different methods being used. The availability of detailed case and serology data in an island outbreak setting, combined with mathematical models, presented a unique opportunity to gain crucial insights into these infections. Our analysis provides evidence that seasonal variation in transmission, combined with other co-circulating flaviviruses, means the timing of ZIKV introduction can have a major impact on outbreak transmission dynamics.; ",
A general modeling framework for exploring the impact of individual concern and personal protection on vector-borne disease dynamics,"Roosa, K; Fefferman, NH","Background: As climate variability and extreme weather events associated with climate change become more prevalent, public health authorities can expect to face an expanding spectrum of vector-borne diseases with increasing incidence and geographical spread. Common interventions include the use of larvicides and adulticides, as well as targeted communications to increase public awareness regarding the need for personal protective measures, such as mosquito repellant, protective clothing, and mosquito nets. Here, we propose a simplified compartmental model of mosquito-borne disease dynamics that incorporates the use of personal protection against mosquito bites influenced by two key individual-level behavioral drivers-concern for being bitten by mosquitos as a nuisance and concern for mosquito-borne disease transmission.Methods: We propose a modified compartmental model that describes the dynamics of vector-borne disease spread in a naive population while considering the public demand for community-level control and, importantly, the effects of personal-level protection on population-level outbreak dynamics. We consider scenarios at low, medium, and high levels of community-level vector control, and at each level, we consider combinations of low, medium, and high levels of motivation to use personal protection, namely concern for disease transmission and concern for being bitten in general.Results: When there is very little community-level vector control, nearly the entire population is quickly infected, regardless of personal protection use. When vector control is at an intermediate level, both concerns that motivate the use of personal protection play an important role in reducing disease burden. When authorities have the capacity for high-level community vector control through pesticide use, the motivation to use personal protection to reduce disease transmission has little additional effect on the outbreak.Conclusions: While results show that personal-level protection alone is not enough to significantly impact an outbreak, personal protective measures can significantly reduce the severity of an outbreak in conjunction with community-level control. Furthermore, the model provides insight for targeting public health messaging to increase the use of personal protection based on concerns related to being bitten by mosquitos or vector-borne disease transmission.",2022,,PARASITES & VECTORS,15,1,,WOS:000865176800001,10.1186/s13071-022-05481-7,,#7798,Roosa 2022,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; Extractor (2024-06-05 20:12:26)(Select): not zika specific; ,
Sexual Transmission of Arboviruses: A Systematic Review,"Blitvich, BJ; Magalhaes, T; Laredo-Tiscareño, SV; Foy, BD","Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are primarily maintained in nature in transmission cycles between hematophagous arthropods and vertebrate hosts, but an increasing number of arboviruses have been isolated from or indirectly detected in the urogenital tract and sexual secretions of their vertebrate hosts, indicating that further investigation on the possibility of sexual transmission of these viruses is warranted. The most widely recognized sexually-transmitted arbovirus is Zika virus but other arboviruses, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and dengue virus, might also be transmitted, albeit occasionally, by this route. This review summarizes our current understanding on the ability of arboviruses to be sexually transmitted. We discuss the sexual transmission of arboviruses between humans and between vertebrate animals, but not arthropod vectors.

Impact on blood safety of the last arboviruses outbreaks in French Polynesia (2012-2018),"Beau, F; Lastère, S; Mallet, HP; Mauguin, S; Broult, J; Laperche, S","Background. - Several successive arbovirus outbreaks have affected French Polynesia (FP) in the recent past years due to different dengue serotypes (DENV) present for several decades, Zika (ZIKV) (2013-2014) and chikungunya (CHIKV) (2014-2015) viruses with a potential impact on blood safety and blood supply due to the geographical isolation of these islands. This study reports an assessment of the impact of these outbreaks on blood products supply and infectious safety in FP and discuss the effectiveness of implemented preventive measures.Methods. - To ensure the infectious safety of blood products during outbreaks, several measures have successively been introduced as the selection of donors suspected of infection, the nucleic acid testing (NAT) and the pathogen reduction of platelets and plasmas.Results. - The donor deferral rate increased by 6% between 2012 and 2014 without changes in the number of collected donations. NAT excluded five blood donations reactive for DENV RNA, 42 for ZIKV and 34 for CHIKV. As Zika screening could not been implemented before the third month of the outbreak, 36 blood products from ZIKV-infected donors were transfused to 26 recipients. However, no transfusion-transmitted arbovirus has been reported.Conclusion. - The last past arboviruses outbreaks did not have a significant impact on blood supply in FP. The measures introduced to prevent arbovirus transmission by transfusion were able to maintain infectious safety for all blood products without impairing self-sufficiency.

As a secondary aim, we investigated the possible etiology of the microcephaly.Method: This retrospective study utilized newborn participants in the Zika Cohort Study Jundiai. Newborns from the Zika Cohort Study Jundiai with an accurate gestational age determination and complete anthropometric data were analyzed, and microcephaly was diagnosed according to the INTERGROWTH-21st curve. At delivery, fluids were tested for specific antibodies and for viruses. Brain images were evaluated for microcephaly. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were plotted to define the accuracy of different cutoff points for microcephaly diagnosis.Results: Of 462 eligible newborns, 19 (4.1%) were positive for microcephaly. Cutoff points corresponding to the curves of the World Health Organization yielded the best sensitivity and specificity. Three of the microcephaly cases (15.8%) were positive for Zika virus infections; nine (47.4%) had intrauterine growth restriction; one had intrauterine growth restriction and was exposed to Zika virus; three had a genetic syndrome (15.8%); and three had causes that had not been determined (15.8%).Conclusions: Microcephaly prevalence was 4.1% in this study. Cutoff values determined by the World Health Organization had the highest sensitivity and specificity in relation to the standard IG curve. The main reason for microcephaly was intrauterine growth restriction. All possible causes of microcephaly must be investigated to allow the best development of an affected baby.

However, uncertainties about the epidemiology of emerging pathogens can make it difficult to choose among alternative model structures and assumptions. To assess the potential for uncertainties about emerging pathogens to affect forecasts of their spread, we evaluated the performance 16 forecasting models in the context of the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia. Each model featured a different combination of assumptions about human mobility, spatiotemporal variation in transmission potential, and the number of virus introductions.

In this review, we offer a brief primer on the scope and methods of phylogenomic analyses that can answer key epidemiological questions during mosquito-borne virus public health emergencies. We then focus on case examples of outbreaks, including those caused by dengue, Zika, yellow fever, West Nile, and chikungunya viruses, to demonstrate the utility of genomic epidemiology to support the prevention and control of mosquito-borne virus threats. We extend these case studies with operational perspectives on how to best incorporate genomic epidemiology into structured surveillance and response programs for mosquito-borne virus control.

Changing risk of arboviral emergence in Catalonia due to higher probability of autochthonous outbreaks,"López, L; Dommar, C; San José, A; Meyers, L; Fox, S; Castro, L; Rodó, X","Background: The lack of previous exposure to arbovirus and the ongoing geographical expansion of viable vector populations has fostered the implementation of preventive strategies in those areas more prone to disease importation. Catalonia receives a wealth of travelers from Southeast Asia, South America and the Caribbean and around 700 cases of imported arbovirosis (2012-2016, totaling dengue, chikungunya, and Zika), have been notified in primary care health centers, traveler advice public health services and main hospitals. With the large asymptomatic proportion of infections well-known for these diseases, the threat for autochthonous outbreaks increases in those areas that, for particular environmental and socio-demographic conditions, might be more susceptible. Operational early-warning systems are lacking in most places where these outbreaks pose a serious health treat.Methods: Here we present the ARBOCAT platform for the prediction of autochthonous outbreaks of ar-boviruses emanating from imported cases, implemented for Catalonia at municipality resolution. Three sub-models provide estimations for importation rates and the basic reproduction number and their outcomes are used to fit a stochastic compartmental model that yields the generation time and the risk of local outbreaks for 948 municipalities. We used also ISIMIP-2b (The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project) temperature data to generate future outbreak risk maps for the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios (where RCP is Representative Concentration Trajectories).Findings: Substantial differences exist between the low and middle-risk scenarios but most Catalonia munici-palities are not at risk for a sustained epidemic. Instead, high R0 are obtained for the maximum risk scenario, with the number of municipalities affected being over 150. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, many of the highest risk areas lie in the most populated cities in the coastal region, particularly in the south near to the Ebre's river.Interpretation: The current outbreak risk is low, both for the mean and minimum temperature scenarios and rises in the high-risk situation. Projections for 2050 are not so optimistic, leading to a significant increase in affected municipalities, over 100, mainly in the coastal area due to the temperature increase followed in RCP 8.5.",2023,,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,477,,,WOS:000918139000001,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.110258,,#7864,López 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Impact of venereal transmission on the dynamics of vertically transmitted viral diseases among mosquitoes,"Nadim, SS; Ghosh, I; Martcheva, M; Chattopadhyay, J","Despite centuries of enormous control efforts, mosquito-borne diseases continue to show upward trend of morbidity. According to WHO reports, malaria caused 438000 deaths in the year 2015 and dengue cases have been increased 30-fold over the last five decades. To control these diseases, it is necessary to understand the transmission dynamics of them among mosquitoes. There are some vertically transmitted mosquito-borne diseases which can also be spread among mosquitoes through sexual contact (e.g., dengue, zika, chikungunya). Recent experimental observations indicate that for virus persistence in mosquito population, the role of venereal transmission cannot be ignored. It is therefore important to investigate which transmission route is more responsible for the persistence of the virus when there is no host. To this aim, we propose and analyze a novel compartmental model considering mosquito population only. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first attempt to take into account both vertical and sexual transmission of the virus in a mathematical model. Expression representing the basic reproduction number is derived using Jacobian approach. Local stability conditions for disease-free equilibrium and complete infection equilibrium are obtained. Global sensitivity analysis of the system is performed with respect to an epidemiologically important response. While investigating the impact of sexual transmission in presence of vertical transmission, we observed that sexual transmission route has the potential to drive the equilibrium from disease free to endemic states. Further numerical experiments reveal that the virus will have higher half life in fertilized infected female mosquitoes for vertical transmission only than for venereal transmission alone. Furthermore, when both transmission pathways are active, a variety of parameters indicate threshold like behavior of the infection.",2020,,MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES,325,,,WOS:000541263900005,10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108366,,#7884,Nadim 2020,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-10-24 19:16:31)(Select): mosquito model only; ,

MODELING SPATIAL WAVES OF WOLBACHIA INVASION FOR CONTROLLING MOSQUITO-BORNE DISEASES,"Qu, ZL; Wu, T; Hyman, JM","Wolbachia is a natural bacterium that can infect mosquitoes and reduce their ability to transmit mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya. Field trials and modeling studies have shown that the fraction of infection among the mosquitoes must exceed a threshold level for the infection to persist. To capture this threshold, it is critical to consider the spatial heterogeneity in the distributions of the infected and uninfected mosquitoes created by a local release of the infected mosquitoes. We develop and analyze PDE models to study the invasion dynamics of Wolbachia infection among mosquitoes in the field. Our reaction-diffusion-type models account for the complex vertical transmission and the spatial mosquito dispersion. We characterize the threshold for a successful invasion with a bubble-shaped distribution, called the ""critical bubble."" The critical bubble is optimal in its release size compared to other spatial profiles in a one-dimensional landscape. The fraction of infection near the release center is higher than the threshold level for the corresponding homogeneously mixing ODE models. We show that the proposed spatial models give rise to the traveling waves of Wolbachia infection when above the threshold. We quantify how the threshold condition and traveling-wave velocity depend on the diffusion coefficients and other model parameters. Numerical studies for different scenarios are presented to inform the design of release strategies.",2022,,SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS,82,6,1903-1929,WOS:000889580200002,10.1137/21M1440384,,#7931,Qu 2022,Exclusion reason: not transmission model; Extractor (2024-06-17 20:20:43)(Select): only mosquitoes; ,

Spreading speeds and traveling wave solutions of diffusive vector-borne disease models without monotonicity,"Wang, XJ; Lin, G; Ruan, SG","Vector-borne diseases, such as chikungunya, dengue, malaria, West Nile virus, yellow fever and Zika, pose a major global public health problem worldwide. In this paper we investigate the propagation dynamics of diffusive vector-borne disease models in the whole space, which characterize the spatial expansion of the infected hosts and infected vectors. Due to the lack of monotonicity, the comparison principle cannot be applied directly to this system. We determine the spreading speed and minimal wave speed when the basic reproduction number of the corresponding kinetic system is larger than one. The spreading speed is mainly estimated by the uniform persistence argument and generalized principal eigenvalue. We also show that solutions converge locally uniformly to the positive equilibrium by employing two auxiliary monotone systems. Moreover, it is proven that the spreading speed is the minimal wave speed of travelling wave solutions. In particular, the uniqueness and monotonicity of travelling waves are obtained. When the basic reproduction number of the corresponding kinetic system is not larger than one, it is shown that solutions approach to the disease-free equilibrium uniformly and there is no travelling wave solutions.

Barreiras is a city with 157,638 inhabitants in the West of the State of Bahia, Northeast of Brazil. The climate is dry, with well-determined and concentrated seasons of rains. The city is crossed by a Federal Highway and by the Rio Grande river. In this study, we aimed to understand the dynamics of mosquito vectors and arboviral diseases in Barreiras. We used correlation statistics to investigate a possible relationship among rains, mosquito abundance and transmission of diseases. In addition, as a preliminary population genetics estimate, we used geometric morphometrics to compare mosquitoes from areas limited by a highway and a river. We found that i) infestation occurs in rain-dependent cycles and that ii) both, the river and the highway segregate populations of A. aegypti in different areas of the studied city.

Transfusion risk associated with recent arbovirus outbreaks in French Polynesia,"Beau, F; Mallet, HP; Lastère, S; Broult, J; Laperche, S","Background and objectives French Polynesia, where dengue virus (DENV) has been present for a long time, experienced two successive outbreaks of Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya viruses (CHIKV) between 2013 and 2015. To avoid the transmission of these viruses by transfusion, nucleic acid testing (NAT) has been in place for DENV since 2013 and for ZIKV and CHIKV during epidemics. The objective was to compare the estimated risk of viraemic blood donation with NAT results and to discuss the impact on the prevention of transfusion-related infectious risk. Materials and methods The average risks of viraemic blood donation were estimated per year for DENV, and during the epidemic periods for ZIKV and CHIKV, using the Biggerstaff and Petersen model based on the incidence rate, the mean length of viraemia and the frequency of asymptomatic infection. The estimated risks were compared with the number of viraemic blood donations detected by NAT. Results According to the different assumptions, risks estimates ranged from 11 center dot 2 to 53 center dot 1/100 000 donations for DENV, 746 to 1924/100 000 for ZIKV and 1083 /100 000 for CHIKV. When compared to the number of donations collected during the study periods, these estimates match NAT results (5 blood donors reactive for DENV, 42 for ZIKV and 34 for CHIKV). Conclusion The risks of viraemic blood donation were related to the viral incidence in the general population and concordant with NAT results. These findings suggest that the screening may be optimized by a targeted NAT implementation based on incidence data.",2020,,VOX SANGUINIS,115,2,124-132,WOS:000502875400001,10.1111/vox.12855,,#8049,Beau 2020,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-08-22 18:42:33)(Select): risk factor ?; ,
A critical assessment of mosquito control and the influence of climate change on mosquito-borne disease epidemics,"Anoopkumar, AN; Aneesh, EM","The world has experienced perceptible climate change for the past 100 years. Global warming enhances the rapid spread of mosquito-borne diseases resulting in unknown consequences in the future. The global economic development, increased urbanization, and climate change have significantly increased the mosquito-borne disease transmission pattern and dynamics. In India, mosquito-borne diseases have been a core public issue for decades. Hence, mosquito control is primordial for preventing the transmission of malaria, lymphatic filariasis, dengue fever, Yellow fever, Zika virus infection, West Nile fever, and chikungunya virus infection in the human population. The mosquito control strategies based on ecology have received much more attention during the 1960s, as chemical pesticides induce negative impacts on human health and the ecosystem. Most of the current approaches in mosquito control have several limitations related to the development of insecticide resistance, lack of long-term sustainability, and negative impacts on the ecosystem and the environment. This review offers invaluable insights into severe mosquito-borne diseases, various vector control strategies, and the influence of climate change in mosquito-borne disease transmission.",2022,,ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,24,6,8900-8929,WOS:000691923700003,10.1007/s10668-021-01792-4,,#8050,Anoopkumar 2022,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,
Identification of risk areas for arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti in northern Brazil: A One Health analysis,"Gomes, H; de Jesus, AG; Quaresma, JA","Introduction: The complex and growing problem generated by the rapid expansion of unplanned urban areas includes high population density and increased infestation by vectors responsible for the transmission of several diseases. This requires interdisciplinary and intersectoral interventions due to the burden of diseases, especially those caused by arboviruses, which can present severe forms and generate significant pressure on health systems, especially in more vulnerable regions. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti (dengue, Zika, and chikungunya) and assess their correlations with demographic, social, and environmental data from the state of Tocantins, Brazil.Methods: This was an ecological time series study of the dengue, Zika, and chikungunya arboviruses in the state of Tocantins. Local Moran's indices were used to observe the spatial autocorrelation of cases and to delimit clusters of high and low risks, correlating them with socioenvironmental indicators, in addition to analyses to detect case clusters.Results: The state reported a mean incidence of 591 annual cases of arbovirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants and a stationary trend with seasonal pattern. Female Pardo individuals aged 20-39 years, with an education level of below college education, were the most affected; Palmas and Araguaina, the two largest cities in the state in terms of economy and population, were the most affected.Conclusion: A better understanding of the interaction between social characteristics, the environment, and ecology of wild animals and vectors is important for the development of mechanisms to predict outbreaks as well as to develop strategies to reduce and/or mitigate recurring arboviral epidemics and other diseases.",2023,,ONE HEALTH,16,,,WOS:001004047400001,10.1016/j.onehlt.2023.100499,,#8054,Gomes 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-03-24 22:14:31)(Screen): check if any zika-specific risk factors; ,
Mosquito-borne viral diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a review,"Mbanzulu, KM; Mboera, LEG; Luzolo, FK; Wumba, R; Misinzo, G; Kimera, SI","Background Mosquito-borne viral infections have in recent years, become a public health threat globally. This review aimed to provide an overview of the ecological and epidemiological profiles of mosquito-borne viral infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Methods A search of literature was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed and the WHO website using the following keywords: ""Democratic Republic of the Congo"", ""Zaire"", ""Belgian Congo"" and either of the following: ""mosquito-borne virus"", ""arbovirus"", ""yellow fever"", ""dengue"", ""chikungunya"", ""West Nile"", ""Rift Valley fever"", ""O'nyong'nyong"", ""Zika"", ""epidemiology"", ""ecology"", ""morbidity"", ""mortality"". Published articles in English or French covering a period between 1912 and October 2018 were reviewed. Results A total of 37 articles were included in the review. The findings indicate that the burden of mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC is increasing over time and space. The north-western, north-eastern, western and central regions have the highest burden of mosquito-borne viral infections compared to south and eastern highland regions. Yellow fever, chikungunya, dengue, Zika, Rift Valley fever, West Nile and O'nyong'nyong have been reported in the country. These mosquito-borne viruses were found circulating in human, wildlife and domestic animals. Yellow fever and chikungunya outbreaks have been frequently reported. Aedes aegypti and Ae. simpsoni were documented as the main vectors of most of the mosquito-borne viral infections. Heavy rains, human movements, forest encroachment and deforestation were identified as drivers of mosquito-borne viruses occurrence in DRC. Conclusions Mosquito-borne viral infections are becoming common and a serious public health problem in DRC. In the current context of climate change, there is urgent need to improve understanding on ecological and epidemiology of the diseases and strengthen surveillance systems for prompt response to epidemics in DRC.",2020,,PARASITES & VECTORS,13,1,,WOS:000521089600002,10.1186/s13071-020-3985-7,,#8077,Mbanzulu 2020,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Chikungunya virus antepartum transmission and abnormal infant outcomes in a cohort of pregnant women in Nigeria,"Sagay, AS; Hsieh, SC; Dai, YC; Chang, CA; Ogwuche, J; Ige, OO; Kahansim, ML; Chaplin, B; Imade, G; Elujoba, M; Paul, M; Hamel, DJ; Furuya, H; Khouri, R; Boaventura, VS; de Moraes, L; Kanki, PJ; Wang, WK","Objectives: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a reemerging global public health concern, which causes acute febrile illness, rash, and arthralgia and may affect both mothers and infants during pregnancy. Motherto-child transmission (MTCT) of CHIKV in Africa remains understudied. Methods: Our cohort study screened 1006 pregnant women with a Zika/dengue/CHIKV rapid test at two clinics in Nigeria between 2019 and 2022. Women who tested positive for the rapid test were followed through their pregnancy and their infants were observed for 6 months, with a subset tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and neutralization, to investigate seropositivity rates and MTCT of CHIKV. Results: Of the 1006, 119 tested positive for CHIKV immunoglobulin (Ig)M, of which 36 underwent detailed laboratory tests. While none of the IgM reactive samples were RT-PCR positive, 14 symptomatic pregnant women were confirmed by CHIKV neutralization test. Twelve babies were followed with eight normal and four abnormal outcomes, including stillbirth, cleft lip/palate with microcephaly, preterm delivery, polydactyly with sepsis, and jaundice. CHIKV IgM testing identified three possible antepartum transmissions. Conclusion: In Nigeria, we found significant CHIKV infection in pregnancy and possible CHIKV antepartum transmission associated with birth abnormalities. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

Surveillance of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) as a Method for Prevention of Arbovirus Transmission in Urban and Seaport Areas of the Southern Coast of Brazil,"Acero-Sandoval, MA; Palacio-Cortés, AM; Navarro-Silva, MAN","Entomological surveillance is a traditional method to measure presence, distribution, and seasonal variation of vectors in urban areas, and is essential to targeted control activities to prevent arbovirus transmission. Ovitraps as one of the main components of surveillance programs, enable determination of female oviposition behavior, as well as identification of seasonal variations of the vector. The goals of this study were 1) to detect the mosquitos (Aedes aegypti Linnaeus) and (Aedes albopictus Skuse) (Diptera:Culicidae), in Paranagua city, 2) to assess ovitrap positive index (OPI), egg density index (EDI), and their relationship with meteorological variables, and 3) to evaluate the vertical transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The study was carried out in urban areas of Paranagua city, an important port region of Brazil, from June 2017 to November 2018. The city was divided into 16 area-clusters. Three-hundred and thirty-one ovitraps were installed monthly, remaining for four days in selected places. Kernel density maps were done to compare the spatiotemporal distribution of collected eggs. Areas which maintained constant oviposition associated with vector activity were identified and were found to overlap the area-clusters with the highest EDI. As viral RNA was not detected, vertical transmission was likely not a maintenance mechanism of arbovirus circulation in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus vectors. This study reiterates the importance, efficiency, and feasibility of ovitraps to monitor the presence and dynamics of Aedes spp. populations.",2023,,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY,60,1,173-184,WOS:000874585600001,10.1093/jme/tjac143,,#8106,Acero-Sandoval 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
A Phenomenological Epidemic Model Based On the Spatio-Temporal Evolution of a Gaussian Probability Density Function,"Benítez, D; Montero, G; Rodríguez, E; Greiner, D; Oliver, A; González, L; Montenegro, R","A novel phenomenological epidemic model is proposed to characterize the state of infectious diseases and predict their behaviors. This model is given by a new stochastic partial differential equation that is derived from foundations of statistical physics. The analytical solution of this equation describes the spatio-temporal evolution of a Gaussian probability density function. Our proposal can be applied to several epidemic variables such as infected, deaths, or admitted-to-the-Intensive Care Unit (ICU). To measure model performance, we quantify the error of the model fit to real time-series datasets and generate forecasts for all the phases of the COVID-19, Ebola, and Zika epidemics. All parameters and model uncertainties are numerically quantified. The new model is compared with other phenomenological models such as Logistic Grow, Original, and Generalized Richards Growth models. When the models are used to describe epidemic trajectories that register infected individuals, this comparison shows that the median RMSE error and standard deviation of the residuals of the new model fit to the data are lower than the best of these growing models by, on average, 19.6% and 35.7%, respectively. Using three forecasting experiments for the COVID-19 outbreak, the median RMSE error and standard deviation of residuals are improved by the performance of our model, on average by 31.0% and 27.9%, respectively, concerning the best performance of the growth models.",2020,,MATHEMATICS,8,11,,WOS:000593185200001,10.3390/math8112000,,#8121,Benítez 2020,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged in the Americas in 2013 and has caused approximately 2.1 million cases and >600 deaths. A retrospective investigation was undertaken to describe clinical, epidemiological, and viral genomic features associated with deaths caused by CHIKV in Ceara state, northeast Brazil.Methods. Sera, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue samples from 100 fatal cases with suspected arbovirus infection were tested for CHIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Clinical, epidemiological, and death reports were obtained for patients with confirmed CHIKV infection. Logistic regression analysis was undertaken to identify independent factors associated with risk of death during CHIKV infection. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using whole genomes from a subset of cases.Results. Sixty-eight fatal cases had CHIKV infection confirmed by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (52.9%), viral antigen (41.1%), and/or specific immunoglobulin M (63.2%). Co-detection of CHIKV with DENV was found in 22% of fatal cases, ZIKV in 2.9%, and DENV and ZIKV in 1.5%. A total of 39 CHIKV deaths presented with neurological signs and symptoms, and CHIKV-RNA was found in the CSF of 92.3% of these patients. Fatal outcomes were associated with irreversible multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Patients with diabetes appear to die at a higher frequency during the subacute phase. Genetic analysis showed circulation of 2 CHIKV East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineages in Ceara and revealed no unique virus genomic mutation associated with fatal outcome.Conclusions. The investigation of the largest cross-sectional cohort of CHIKV deaths to date reveals that CHIKV-ECSA strains can cause death in individuals from both risk and nonrisk groups, including young adults.",2021,,CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES,73,7,E2436-E2443,WOS:000729829500167,10.1093/cid/ciaa1038,,#8131,deLima 2021,Exclusion reason: Co-infection study; Extractor (2024-05-30 02:44:00)(Select): co-infection with other viruses and CSF study; ,

Microcephaly and Associated Risk Factors in Newborns: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Study,"Melo, ND; de Sousa, DF; Laporta, GZ","Congenital microcephaly is caused by a multitude of drivers affecting maternal-fetal health during pregnancy. It is a rare outcome in high-income industrial countries where microcephaly rates are in the range of 0.3-0.9 per 1000 newborns. Prevalence of microcephaly varies considerably across developing countries and can go as high as 58 cases per 1000 live births in pregnancies exposed to infection by Zika virus (ZIKV). Not only ZIKV-infected pregnancies, but other drivers can modulate the occurrence and severity of this outcome. Here, we sought to test the ZIKV-microcephaly association vs. competing hypotheses using a meta-analysis with 8341 microcephaly cases pooled from 10,250,994 newborns in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Analysis of risk ratios (RR) showed teratogens the most likely microcephaly-associated risk factor (RR = 3.43; 95%-CI 2.69-4.38; p-value < 0.0001), while the statistical significance of the ZIKV-microcephaly association was marginal (RR = 2.12; 95%-CI 1.01-4.48; p-value = 0.048). Other congenital infections showed strong but variable associations with microcephaly (RR = 15.24; 95%-CI 1.74-133.70; p-value = 0.014). Microcephaly cases were associated with impoverished socioeconomic settings, but this association was statistically non-significant (RR = 2.75; 95%-CI 0.55-13.78; p-value = 0.22).

Serum biomarkers and anti-flavivirus antibodies at presentation as indicators of severe dengue,"Bernal, C; Ping, S; Rojas, A; Caballero, O; Stittleburg, V; de Guillén, Y; Langjahr, P; Pinsky, BA; Von-Horoch, M; Luraschi, P; Cabral, S; Sánchez, MC; Torres, A; Cardozo, F; Waggoner, JJ","BackgroundDengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease worldwide. Most cases are mild, but some evolve into severe dengue (SD), with high lethality. Therefore, it is important to identify biomarkers of severe disease to improve outcomes and judiciously utilize resources. Methods/Principal findingsOne hundred forty-five confirmed dengue cases (median age, 42; range <1-91 years), enrolled from February 2018 to March 2020, were selected from an ongoing study of suspected arboviral infections in metropolitan Asuncion, Paraguay. Cases included dengue virus types 1, 2, and 4, and severity was categorized according to the 2009 World Health Organization guidelines. Testing for anti-dengue virus IgM and IgG and serum biomarkers (lipopolysaccharide binding protein and chymase) was performed on acute-phase sera in plate-based ELISAs; in addition, a multiplex ELISA platform was used to measure anti-dengue virus and anti-Zika virus IgM and IgG. Complete blood counts and chemistries were performed at the discretion of the care team. Age, gender, and pre-existing comorbidities were associated with SD vs. dengue with/without warning signs in logistic regression with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.07 (per year; 95% confidence interval, 1.03, 1.11), 0.20 (female; 0.05,0.77), and 2.09 (presence; 1.26, 3.48) respectively. In binary logistic regression, for every unit increase in anti-DENV IgG in the multiplex platform, odds of SD increased by 2.54 (1.19-5.42). Platelet count, lymphocyte percent, and elevated chymase were associated with SD in a combined logistic regression model with ORs of 0.99 (1,000/mu L; 0.98,0.999), 0.92 (%; 0.86,0.98), and 1.17 (mg/mL; 1.03,1.33) respectively. ConclusionsMultiple, readily available factors were associated with SD in this population. These findings will aid in the early detection of potentially severe dengue cases and inform the development of new prognostics for use in acute-phase and serial samples from dengue cases.Author summaryDengue fever is an acute disease caused by dengue virus and transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease worldwide affecting an estimated 50-100 million people and with 10,000 dengue-related deaths each year. Currently, there is no specific treatment, and safe and effective vaccines have not been fully implemented. Most dengue cases present with nonspecific mild symptoms, but some will evolve into severe dengue, which can be fatal. Early detection and subsequent timely treatment have been shown to decrease mortality among severe cases. Therefore, it is very important to identify biomarkers for the early identification of cases at risk for progression to severe disease. In this study we analyze demographic factors, clinical laboratory data, lipopolysaccharide binding protein and chymase to evaluate associations with disease severity. This study was carried out in Paraguay, which is a hyperendemic country for dengue where the disease has been understudied. A number of factors were found to be associated with severe disease in this population, including patient age, male gender, presence of comorbid illnesses, low platelet count, low lymphocyte percentage, and elevated chymase level.",2023,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,17,2,,WOS:000942036200001,10.1371/journal.pntd.0010750,,#8191,Bernal 2023,Exclusion reason: Co-infection study; Extractor (2024-06-10 17:21:23)(Select): pop tested for zikv is people with confirmed dengue; ,
Scoping future outbreaks: a scoping review on the outbreak prediction of the WHO Blueprint list of priority diseases,"Jonkmans, N; D'Acremont, V; Flahault, A","Background The WHO's Research and Development Blueprint priority list designates emerging diseases with the potential to generate public health emergencies for which insufficient preventive solutions exist. The list aims to reduce the time to the availability of resources that can avert public health crises. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic illustrates that an effective method of mitigating such crises is the pre-emptive prediction of outbreaks. This scoping review thus aimed to map and identify the evidence available to predict future outbreaks of the Blueprint diseases. Methods We conducted a scoping review of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science related to the evidence predicting future outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg virus, Zika virus, Lassa fever, Nipah and Henipaviral disease, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Disease X. Prediction methods, outbreak features predicted and implementation of predictions were evaluated. We conducted a narrative and quantitative evidence synthesis to highlight prediction methods that could be further investigated for the prevention of Blueprint diseases and COVID-19 outbreaks. Results Out of 3959 articles identified, we included 58 articles based on inclusion criteria. 5 major prediction methods emerged; the most frequent being spatio-temporal risk maps predicting outbreak risk periods and locations through vector and climate data. Stochastic models were predominant. Rift Valley fever was the most predicted disease. Diseases with complex sociocultural factors such as Ebola were often predicted through multifactorial risk-based estimations. 10% of models were implemented by health authorities. No article predicted Disease X outbreaks. Conclusions Spatiotemporal models for diseases with strong climatic and vectorial components, as in River Valley fever prediction, may currently best reduce the time to the availability of resources. A wide literature gap exists in the prediction of zoonoses with complex sociocultural and ecological dynamics such as Ebola, COVID-19 and especially Disease X.",2021,,BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH,6,9,,WOS:000697848000009,10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006623,,#8192,Jonkmans 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

The Structural dump in Brasilia, Brazil, was the largest Latin American open-air dump until its closure in 2018. Thus, this study sought to investigate the prevalence of self-reported dengue, Zika and Chikungunya arbovirus infections in waste pickers who worked at the dumpsite and assess its association with the sanitary conditions in their residences and workplaces. This research used a mixed methods study using a questionnaire for the quantitative method and semi-structured interviews for the qualitative portion. A cross-sectional, observational, epidemiological study along with a phenomenological study were carried out to characterize socio environmental, occupational and health-related aspects to vector-borne diseases in Structural dumpsite in Brazil. Of the 1,025 respondents, 301 (29.2%) reported to have gotten sick from dengue, Zika or chikungunya fevers. We found significant associations between place of residence of waste pickers (p = 0,003) and the work conditions, use of personal protective equipment (p < 0.001) and weekly workload (p = 0.04) and occurrence of vector-borne disease. Results were confirmed by qualitative data and geo-referencing, in relation to location of their homes and proximity to the dumpsite, as well as through the vulnerability due to their working conditions. This research confirms that waste pickers are highly susceptible to vector-borne diseases; this situation that needs to be immediately addressed by interdisciplinary and intersectoral approaches in waste management and public health. This information confirms vulnerability of waste pickers to diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquito as a result of sanitary conditions at their residence and workplace. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The threat of mosquito-borne arboviral disease in Spain: A bibliographic review,"Laycock, T; Paniego, CU; Javier, J","Over the last two decades there has been an increase in outbreaks of arboviral diseases, being Spain at high risk for disease emergence. This paper reviews the current evidence regarding the transmissibility, disease epidemiology, control strategies and mosquito-borne disease drivers and maintaining factors in Spain. There is risk of autochthonous cases and outbreaks in Spain due to recent transmission occurrence. Recently, there has been an expansion ofAedes Albopticus, a vector for Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya; and Cullex spp., vector for West Nile Virus, already endemic in Spain. Their establishment has been facilitated by climate and environmental drivers.

"Molecular surveillance of arboviruses circulation and co-infection during a large chikungunya virus outbreak in Thailand, October 2018 to February 2020","Khongwichit, S; Chuchaona, W; Vongpunsawad, S; Poovorawan, Y","A large national outbreak of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was recently reported in Thailand. While dengue virus (DENV) infection tends to occur year-round with an upsurge in the rainy season, Zika virus (ZIKV) also circulates in the country. The overlap in the distribution of these viruses increased the probability of co-infections during the heightened CHIKV activity. By examining 1806 patient serum samples submitted for CHIKV diagnostics from October 2018-February 2020 (511 CHIKV-negatives and 1295 CHIKV-positives), we used real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to identify DENV and ZIKV individually. A total of 29 ZIKV and 36 DENV single-infections were identified. Interestingly, 13 co-infection cases were observed, of which 8 were CHIKV/DENV, 3 were CHIKV/ZIKV, and 2 were DENV/ZIKV. There were six DENV genotypes (13 DENV-1 genotype I, 10 DENV-2 Asian I, 10 DENV-2 Cosmopolitan, 6 DENV-3 genotype I, 2 DENV-3 genotype III, and 5 DENV-4 genotype I). Additionally, ZIKV strains identified in this study either clustered with strains previously circulating in Thailand and Singapore, or with strains previously reported in China, French Polynesia, and the Americas. Our findings reveal the co-infection and genetic diversity patterns of mosquito-borne viruses circulating in Thailand.",2022,,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,12,1,,WOS:000920807400029,10.1038/s41598-022-27028-7,,#8287,Khongwichit 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Contribution of Viral Respiratory Infections to Dengue-Like Illness Presentation at a Community Clinic in Southern Malaysia,"Dhanoa, A; Ngim, CF; Yunos, NM; Husain, SMT; Pong, LY; Ismail, WFW; Hontz, RD; Hassan, SS","This study explored the contribution of viral respiratory infections (VRIs) in dengue-like illness (DLI) patients and their distinguishing clinicolaboratory parameters. Two hundred DLI patients were prospectively recruited (July 1- October 1, 2019) from a community clinic in Southern Malaysia. Patients >_ 18 years with acute fever and fulfilling the WHO criteria of probable dengue were recruited. They underwent blood testing: blood counts, rapid dengue tests (nonstructural antigen-1/IgM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and Leptospira. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) were collected for FilmArrayVR RP2plus testing. From the 200 NPSs, 58 respiratory viruses (RVs) were detected in 54 patients. Of the 96 dengue-confirmed cases, 86 had dengue mono-infection, and 10 were coinfected with RVs. Of the 104 nondengue, 44 were RV positive and 4 Leptospira positive. Zika and chikungunya virus were not detected. Overall, the etiological diagnosis was confirmed for 72% of patients. Clinicolaboratory parameters were compared between dengue mono-infection and VRI mono-infection. Patients with coinfections were excluded. Multiple logistic regression showed that recent household/neighborhood history of dengue (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.9, 95% CI = 1.7-20.7), leukopenia (aOR: 12.5, 95% CI = 2.6-61.4) and thrombocytopenia (aOR: 5.5, 95% CI = 1.3-23.0) predicted dengue. Inversely, rhinorrhoea (aOR: 0.1, 95% CI = 0.01-0.3) and cough (aOR: 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-0.9) favored VRI. Thus, VRIs comprise many infections diagnosed initially as DLIs.

"Arboviral diseases and poverty in Alabama, 2007-2017","Bisanzio, D; Martello, E; Izenour, K; Stevens, K; Kaur, R; McKenzie, BA; Kraemer, M; Reithinger, R; Zohdy, S","Author summary Mosquito-borne arboviruses like West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus (ZIKV), California serogroup virus (CSV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE), and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLE) are on the rise globally. Socioeconomic and environmental conditions have played a role in directing in this expansion by creating conditions ideal for mosquito vectors and transmission. In this study, we used 10 years (2007-2017) of county level human arboviral case data from the US state of Alabama to better understand the roles socioeconomics (poverty rate) and environmental (land use, precipitation, land cover) conditions may play in driving patterns of arboviral disease in the southern US. We found a significant association between poverty rate and incidence of WNV, an arbovirus primarily transmitted by Culex spp. mosquitoes, which are known for thriving in contaminated water sources and sewage overflow. Conversely, cases of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, arboviruses primarily transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, were reported in areas of high socioeconomic status. These findings suggest differential distribution of arboviruses relevant to human health in Alabama, and that poverty in the southern US is a significant factor that should be considered when planning WNV prevention and intervention strategies.Mosquito-borne viruses cause diseases of great public health concern. Arboviral disease case distributions have complex relationships with socioeconomic and environmental factors. We combined information about socio-economic (population, and poverty rate) and environmental (precipitation, and land use) characteristics with reported human cases of arboviral disease in the counties of Alabama, USA, from 2007-2017. We used county level data on West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus (ZIKV), California serogroup virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, and Saint Louis encephalitis virus to provide a detailed description of their spatio-temporal pattern. We found a significant spatial convergence between incidence of WNV and poverty rate clustered in the southern part of Alabama. DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV cases showed a different spatial pattern, being mostly located in the northern part, in areas of high socioeconomic status. The results of our study establish that poverty-driven inequities in arboviral risk exist in the southern USA, and should be taken into account when planning prevention and intervention strategies.",2021,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,15,7,,WOS:000674292000002,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009535,,#8324,Bisanzio 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Burden of mosquito-borne diseases across rural versus urban areas in Cameroon between 2002 and 2021: prospective for community-oriented vector management approaches,"Alenou, LD; Nwane, P; Mbakop, LR; Piameu, M; Ekoko, W; Mandeng, S; Bikoy, EN; Toto, JC; Onguina, H; Etang, J","Background Over the past two decades, Cameroon has recorded one of the highest rates of urban population growth in sub-Saharan Africa. It is estimated that more than 67% of Cameroon's urban population lives in slums, and the situation is far from improving as these neighbourhoods are growing at an annual rate of 5.5%. However, it is not known how this rapid and uncontrolled urbanization affects vector populations and disease transmission in urban versus rural areas. In this study, we analyse data from studies conducted on mosquito-borne diseases in Cameroon between 2002 and 2021 to determine the distribution of mosquito species and the prevalence of diseases they transmit with regards to urban areas versus rural areas.Methods A search of various online databases, such as PubMed, Hinari, Google and Google Scholar, was conducted for relevant articles. A total of 85 publications/reports were identified and reviewed for entomological and epidemiological data from the ten regions of Cameroon.Results Analysis of the findings from the reviewed articles revealed 10 diseases transmitted by mosquitoes to humans across the study regions. Most of these diseases were recorded in the Northwest Region, followed by the North, Far North and Eastern Regions. Data were collected from 37 urban and 28 rural sites. In the urban areas, dengue prevalence increased from 14.55% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2-23.9%) in 2002-2011 to 29.84% (95% CI 21-38.7%) in 2012-2021. In rural areas, diseases such as Lymphatic filariasis and Rift valley fever, which were not present in 2002-2011, appeared in 2012-2021, with a prevalence of 0.4% (95% CI 0.0-2.4%) and 10% (95% CI 0.6-19.4%), respectively. Malaria prevalence remained the same in urban areas (67%; 95% CI 55.6-78.4%) between the two periods, while it significantly decreased in rural areas from 45.87% (95% CI 31.1-60.6%) in 2002-2011 to 39% (95% CI 23.7-54.3%) in the 2012-2021 period (*P = 0.04). Seventeen species of mosquitoes were identified as involved in the transmission of these diseases, of which 11 were involved in the transmission of malaria, five in the transmission of arboviruses and one in the transmission of malaria and lymphatic filariasis. The diversity of mosquito species was greater in rural areas than in urban areas during both periods. Of the articles reviewed for the 2012-2021 period, 56% reported the presence of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato in urban areas compared to 42% reported in 2002-2011. The presence of Aedes aegypti increased in urban areas in 2012-2021 but this species was absent in rural areas. Ownership of long-lasting insecticidal nets varied greatly from one setting to another.Conclusions The current findings suggest that, in addition to malaria control strategies, vector-borne disease control approaches in Cameroon should include strategies against lymphatic filariasis and Rift Valley fever in rural areas, and against dengue and Zika viruses in urban areas.",2023,,PARASITES & VECTORS,16,1,,WOS:000975541400001,10.1186/s13071-023-05737-w,,#8369,Alenou 2023,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
"Insights into the structure, functional perspective, and pathogenesis of ZIKV: an updated review","Bhat, EA; Ali, T; Sajjad, N; Kumar, R; Bron, P","Zika virus (ZIKV) poses a serious threat to the entire world. The rapid spread of ZIKV and recent outbreaks since 2007 have caused worldwide concern about the virus. Diagnosis is complicated because of the cross-reactivity of the virus with other viral antibodies. Currently, the virus is diagnosed by molecular techniques such as RT-PCR and IgM-linked enzyme immunoassays (MAC-ELISA). Recently, outbreaks and epidemics have been caused by ZIKV, and severe clinical symptoms and congenital malformations have also been associated with the virus. Although most ZIKV infections present with a subclinical or moderate flu-like course of illness, severe symptoms such as Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults and microcephaly in children of infected mothers have also been reported. Because there is no reliable cure for ZIKV and no vaccine is available, the public health response has focused primarily on preventing infection, particularly in pregnant women. A comprehensive approach is urgently needed to combat this infection and stop its spread and imminent threat. In view of this, this review aims to present the current structural and functional viewpoints, structure, etiology, clinical prognosis, and measures to prevent this transmission based on the literature and current knowledge. Moreover, we provide thorough description of the current understanding about ZIKV interaction with receptors, and a comparative examination of its similarities and differences with other viruses.",2023,,BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY,165,,,WOS:001147267400001,10.1016/j.biopha.2023.115175,,#8399,Bhat 2023,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-03-23 06:46:09)(Screen): review; ,Review
"Current knowledge of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens in Zambia: A clarion call to scaling-up ""One Health"" research in the wake of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases","Mubemba, B; Mburu, M; Changula, KG; Muleya, WE; Moonga, LE; Chambaro, H; Kajihara, M; Qiu, YJ; Orba, Y; Hayashida, K; Sutcliffe, C; Norris, D; Thuma, P; Ndubani, P; Chitanga, S; Sawa, H; Takada, A; Simulundu, E","Author summaryDespite vector-borne zoonoses being a major public health threat globally, they are often overlooked, particularly among resource-constrained countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Zambia. Therefore, we reviewed the current knowledge and identified research gaps of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens in Zambia. We focussed on mosquito-, tick-, flea- and tsetse fly-borne zoonotic pathogens reported in the country. Although we found evidence of circulation of several vector-borne zoonotic pathogens among vectors, animals and humans, clinical cases in humans were rarely reported. This suggests sparse capacity for diagnosis of vector-borne pathogens in healthcare facilities in the country and possibly limited awareness and knowledge of the local epidemiology of these infectious agents. Establishment of facility-based surveillance of vector-borne zoonoses in health facilities could provide valuable insights on morbidity, disease severity, and mortalities associated with infections as well as immune responses. In addition, there is also need for increased genomic surveillance of vector-borne pathogens in vectors and animals and humans for a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of these diseases in Zambia. Furthermore, vector ecology studies aimed at understanding the drivers of vector abundance, pathogen host range (i.e., including the range of vectors and reservoirs), parasite-host interactions and factors influencing frequency of human-vector contacts should be prioritized. The study revealed the need for Zambia to scale-up One Health research in emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases to enable the country to be better prepared for future epidemics, including pandemics.BackgroundAlthough vector-borne zoonotic diseases are a major public health threat globally, they are usually neglected, especially among resource-constrained countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa. This scoping review examined the current knowledge and identified research gaps of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens in Zambia. Methods and findingsMajor scientific databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, CABI, Scientific Information Database (SID)) were searched for articles describing vector-borne (mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and tsetse flies) zoonotic pathogens in Zambia. Several mosquito-borne arboviruses have been reported including Yellow fever, Ntaya, Mayaro, Dengue, Zika, West Nile, Chikungunya, Sindbis, and Rift Valley fever viruses. Flea-borne zoonotic pathogens reported include Yersinia pestis and Rickettsia felis. Trypanosoma sp. was the only tsetse fly-borne pathogen identified. Further, tick-borne zoonotic pathogens reported included Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever virus, Rickettsia sp., Anaplasma sp., Ehrlichia sp., Borrelia sp., and Coxiella burnetii. ConclusionsThis study revealed the presence of many vector-borne zoonotic pathogens circulating in vectors and animals in Zambia. Though reports of human clinical cases were limited, several serological studies provided considerable evidence of zoonotic transmission of vector-borne pathogens in humans. However, the disease burden in humans attributable to vector-borne zoonotic infections could not be ascertained from the available reports and this precludes the formulation of national policies that could help in the control and mitigation of the impact of these diseases in Zambia. Therefore, there is an urgent need to scale-up ""One Health"" research in emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases to enable the country to prepare for future epidemics, including pandemics.",2022,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,16,2,,WOS:000752220100002,10.1371/journal.pntd.0010193,,#8492,Mubemba 2022,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-05-04 01:08:25)(Select): irrelevant review; ,Review

Furthermore, an updated review on the current arbovirus burden and associated mosquito vectors is lacking for this region. To contribute to filling this knowledge gap, the current study was designed with the following objectives: (i) to systematically review data on the occurrence and distribution of arboviruses and mosquito fauna; and (ii) to identify potential spillover mosquito species in the Central African region in the last 30 years. A web search enabled the documentation of 2454 articles from different online databases. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and the quality of reporting of meta-analyses (QUORUM) steps for a systematic review enabled the selection of 164 articles that fulfilled our selection criteria. Of the six arboviruses (dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), and West Nile virus (WNV)) of public health concern studied, the most frequently reported were chikungunya and dengue. The entomological records showed >248 species of mosquitoes regrouped under 15 genera, with Anopheles (n = 100 species), Culex (n = 56 species), and Aedes (n = 52 species) having high species diversity. Three genera were rarely represented, with only one species included, namely, Orthopodomyia, Lutzia, and Verrallina, but individuals of the genera Toxorhinchites and Finlayas were not identified at the species level. We found that two Aedes species (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) colonised the same microhabitat and were involved in major epidemics of the six medically important arboviruses, and other less-frequently identified mosquito genera consisted of competent species and were associated with outbreaks of medical and zoonotic arboviruses. The present study reveals a high species richness of competent mosquito vectors that could lead to the spillover of medically important arboviruses in the region. Although epidemiological studies were found, they were not regularly documented, and this also applies to vector competence and transmission studies. Future studies will consider unpublished information in dissertations and technical reports from different countries to allow their information to be more consistent.

Mosquito-Associated Viruses and Their Related Mosquitoes in West Africa,"Agboli, E; Zahouli, JBZ; Badolo, A; Jöst, H","Mosquito-associated viruses (MAVs), including mosquito-specific viruses (MSVs) and mosquito-borne (arbo)viruses (MBVs), are an increasing public, veterinary, and global health concern, and West Africa is projected to be the next front for arboviral diseases. As in-depth knowledge of the ecologies of both western African MAVs and related mosquitoes is still limited, we review available and comprehensive data on their diversity, abundance, and distribution. Data on MAVs' occurrence and related mosquitoes were extracted from peer-reviewed publications. Data on MSVs, and mosquito and vertebrate host ranges are sparse. However, more data are available on MBVs (i.e., dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika, and Rift Valley fever viruses), detected in wild and domestic animals, and humans, with infections more concentrated in urban areas and areas affected by strong anthropogenic changes. Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Aedes albopictus are incriminated as key arbovirus vectors. These findings outline MAV, related mosquitoes, key knowledge gaps, and future research areas.

Socioeconomic risk markers of arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) infections: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis,"Power, GM; Vaughan, AM; Qiao, LX; Clemente, NS; Pescarini, JM; Paixao, ES; Lobkowicz, L; Raja, A; Souza, AP; Barreto, ML; Brickley, EB","Introduction Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are of notable public health importance worldwide, owing to their potential to cause explosive outbreaks and induce debilitating and potentially life-threatening disease manifestations. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the relationship between markers of socioeconomic position (SEP) and infection due to arboviruses with mosquito vectors. Methods We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Embase, and LILACS databases to identify studies published between 1980 and 2020 that measured the association of SEP markers with arbovirus infection. We included observational studies without geographic location or age restrictions. We excluded studies from grey literature, reviews and ecological studies. Study findings were extracted and summarised, and pooled estimates were obtained using random-effects meta-analyses. Results We identified 36 observational studies using data pertaining to 106 524 study participants in 23 geographic locations that empirically examined the relationship between socioeconomic factors and infections caused by seven arboviruses (dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, Sindbis, West Nile and Zika viruses). While results were varied, descriptive synthesis pointed to a higher risk of arbovirus infection associated with markers of lower SEP, including lower education, income poverty, low healthcare coverage, poor housing materials, interrupted water supply, marital status (married, divorced or widowed), non-white ethnicities and migration status. Pooled crude estimates indicated an increased risk of arboviral infection associated with lower education (risk ratio, RR 1.5 95% CI 1.3 to 1.9); I-2=83.1%), interruption of water supply (RR 1.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; I-2=0.0%) and having been married (RR 1.5 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1; I-2=85.2%). Conclusion Evidence from this systematic review suggests that lower SEP increases the risk of acquiring arboviral infection; however, there was large heterogeneity across studies. Further studies are required to delineate the relationship between specific individual, household and community-level SEP indicators and arbovirus infection risks to help inform targeted public health interventions.

The South-East Asia Region had the highest seroprevalences of DENV and CHIKV, while the Region of the Americas had the highest seroprevalence of ZIKV. The seroprevalences of DENV and CHIKV were similar when comparing developed and developing countries, urban and rural areas, or among different populations. In addition, we observed a decreased global seroprevalences in the new decade (2010-2019) comparing to the decade before (2000-2009) for CHIKV. For ZIKV, the positive rates tested with the nucleic acid detection method were lower than those tested with the antibody detection method. Lastly, numerous cases of dual seropositivity for CHIKV and DENV were reported.Conclusions Our results revealed a varied prevalence of arbovirus infections in different geographical regions and countries, and the inapparent infection accounted an unneglected portion of infections that requires more attention. This study will shed lights on our understanding of the true burden of arbovirus infections and promote appropriate vaccination in the future.Author summary DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV infections are the three major neglected tropical diseases continually posing threats to the public health and the socioeconomic development in recent decades. Given a high fraction of inapparent infections of these viruses, it is necessary to obtain informative knowledge of the seroepidemiology of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV worldwide, so as to estimate the true burden of these diseases and evaluate effects on vaccine efficacy and uptake. Given the fact that the reported infection rates may vary greatly due to the measurement, criteria of inclusion, and etc, a systematic review with meta-analysis is essential to collect and summarize the seroepidemiologic evidence of these arboviruses. In this study, the geographical distributions of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV and the proportions of their inapparent infections were analyzed, which revealed an overall high disease burden to the world, especially in specific regions. The epidemiological features of these arboviruses were also characterized via comparisons made in different countries/areas, populations, and time periods. In addition, evidence on the co-infection of DENV and CHIKV was assessed.",2021,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,15,4,,WOS:000664455600003,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009337,,#9071,Li 2021,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Real-time estimation of disease activity in emerging outbreaks using internet search information,"Aiken, EL; McGough, SF; Majumder, MS; Wachtel, G; Nguyen, AT; Viboud, C; Santillana, M","Understanding the behavior of emerging disease outbreaks in, or ahead of, real-time could help healthcare officials better design interventions to mitigate impacts on affected populations. Most healthcare-based disease surveillance systems, however, have significant inherent reporting delays due to data collection, aggregation, and distribution processes. Recent work has shown that machine learning methods leveraging a combination of traditionally collected epidemiological information and novel Internet-based data sources, such as disease-related Internet search activity, can produce meaningful ""nowcasts"" of disease incidence ahead of healthcare-based estimates, with most successful case studies focusing on endemic and seasonal diseases such as influenza and dengue. Here, we apply similar computational methods to emerging outbreaks in geographic regions where no historical presence of the disease of interest has been observed. By combining limited available historical epidemiological data available with disease-related Internet search activity, we retrospectively estimate disease activity in five recent outbreaks weeks ahead of traditional surveillance methods. We find that the proposed computational methods frequently provide useful real-time incidence estimates that can help fill temporal data gaps resulting from surveillance reporting delays. However, the proposed methods are limited by issues of sample bias and skew in search query volumes, perhaps as a result of media coverage.Author summary Public health officials regularly make choices about treatment and prevention in disease outbreaks that have the potential to impact entire affected populations. Often these decisions are based on incomplete or unreliable information due to inherent reporting delays in healthcare-based disease surveillance systems. This issue of public health decision-making based on limited data is even more salient in emerging outbreaks, which are typically characterized by uncertain disease dynamics and limited surveillance capacity. We demonstrate the potential for using digital trace data-in this case, Internet-based information from Google search trends-for estimating disease activity in emerging outbreaks in the absence of accurate real-time healthcare-based data sources. We evaluate how data-driven methods leveraging search trend data would have performed in real-time in five recent outbreaks (yellow fever in Angola, Zika in Colombia, Ebola in the DRC, plague in Madagascar, and cholera in Yemen), and find that the methods frequently provide useful signals of disease activity ahead of standard healthcare-based surveillance methods.",2020,,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,16,8,,WOS:000563933400003,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008117,,#9106,Aiken 2020,Exclusion reason: not transmission model; Extractor (2024-03-19 07:13:41)(Screen): potentially a parameter in case study; ,
Quantifying the relationship between arboviral infection prevalence and human mobility patterns among participants of the Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses cohort (COPA) in southern Puerto Rico,"Phillips, MT; Sánchez-González, L; Shragai, T; Rodriguez, DM; Major, CG; Johansson, MA; Rivera-Amill, V; Paz-Bailey, G; Adams, LE","Human movement is increasingly being recognized as a major driver of arbovirus risk and dissemination. The Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses (COPA) study is a cohort in southern Puerto Rico to measure arboviral prevalence, evaluate interventions, and collect mobility data. To quantify the relationship between arboviral prevalence and human mobility patterns, we fit multilevel logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios for mobility-related predictors of positive chikungunya IgG or Zika IgM test results collected from COPA, assuming mobility data does not change substantially from year to year. From May 8, 2018-June 8, 2019, 39% of the 1,845 active participants during the study period had a positive arboviral seroprevalence result. Most (74%) participants reported spending five or more weekly hours outside of their home. A 1% increase in weekly hours spent outside the home was associated with a 4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2-7%) decrease in the odds of testing positive for arbovirus. After adjusting for age and whether a person had air conditioning (AC) at home, any time spent in a work location was protective against arbovirus infection (32% decrease, CI: 9-49%). In fact, there was a general decreased prevalence for individuals who visited locations that were inside and had AC or screens, regardless of the type of location (32% decrease, CI: 12-47%). In this population, the protective characteristics of locations visited appear to be the most important driver of the relationship between mobility and arboviral prevalence. This relationship indicates that not all mobility is the same, with elements like screens and AC providing protection in some locations. These findings highlight the general importance of AC and screens, which are known to be protective against mosquitoes and mosquito-transmitted diseases.We characterized the relationship between arboviral infection prevalence and human mobility patterns among 1,845 participants in the Communities Organized to Prevent Arboviruses (COPA) study in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Among participants, 39% had a positive arboviral seroprevalence result. The majority (74%) reported spending 5 or more weekly hours outside of their home of residence. In general, more time spent outside the home was associated with decreased arboviral infection prevalence in this population. Arboviral prevalence was associated with the types of locations participants visited regularly, and characteristics of those locations. Work and locations with air conditioning (AC) or screens were protective for arboviral prevalence. Different from other studies, in this population, the characteristics of locations visited appear to be the most important drivers of the relationship between mobility and arboviral prevalence. This relationship indicates that not all mobility is the same, with elements like screens and AC providing protection in some locations. Previous studies have shown that household AC and screens are important factors in determining arboviral risk; however, results from this study further highlight their importance in non-residential locations where people visit. These findings support the use of screens and AC in all locations in areas at risk for arbovirus transmission.",2023,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,17,12,,WOS:001130040600002,10.1371/journal.pntd.0011840,,#9122,Phillips 2023,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; Extractor (2024-08-21 23:59:46)(Select): not disaggregated by arbivirus; ,
Mathematical modeling in perspective of vector-borne viral infections: a review,"Prasad, R; Sagar, SK; Parveen, S; Dohare, R","Background Viral diseases are highly widespread infections caused by viruses. These viruses are passing from one human to other humans through a certain medium. The medium might be mosquito, animal, reservoir and food, etc. Here, the population of both human and mosquito vectors are important. Main body of the abstract The main objectives are here to introduce the historical perspective of mathematical modeling, enable the mathematical modeler to understand the basic mathematical theory behind this and present a systematic review on mathematical modeling for four vector-borne viral diseases using the deterministic approach. Furthermore, we also introduced other mathematical techniques to deal with vector-borne diseases. Mathematical models could help forecast the infectious population of humans and vectors during the outbreak.

Nevertheless, there is limited information about the genomic epidemiology of CHIKV circulating in Brazil from surveillance studies. Thus, to better understand its dispersion dynamics in Rio de Janeiro (RJ), one of the most affected states during the 2016-2019 epidemic waves, we generated 23 near-complete genomes of CHIKV isolates from two main cities located in the metropolitan mesoregion, obtained directly from clinical samples. Our phylogenetic reconstructions suggest the 2019-CHIKV-ECSA epidemic in RJ state was characterized by the co-circulation of multiple clade (clade A and B), high-lighting that two independent introduction events of CHIKV-ECSA into RJ state have occurred between 2016-2019, both mediated from the northeastern region. Interestingly, we identified that the two-clade displaying eighteen characteristic amino acids changes among structural and non-structural proteins.

Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional study including outpatient acute undifferentiated fever in both children and adults, between November 2015 and June 2016 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Serological and molecular diagnostic tests for selected arboviral infections were performed on blood, including PCR, NS1-RDT, ELISA and IFA for acute, and ELISA and IFA for past infections. Results Investigation among 342 patients, aged 2 to 68 years (mean age of 21 years), with acute undifferentiated fever (having no clear focus of infection) revealed 19 (8.1%) acute dengue-caused by DENV-1 and/or DENV-2 -and 2 (0.9%) acute chikungunya infections. Furthermore, 30.2% and 26.4% of participants had been infected in the past with dengue and chikungunya, respectively. We found no evidence of acute Zika nor yellow fever virus infections. 45.3% of patients tested positive on malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test, 87.7% received antimalarial treatment and 64.3% received antibacterial treatment. Discussion Chikungunya outbreaks have been reported in the study area in the past, so the high seroprevalence is not surprising. However, scarce evidence exists on dengue transmission in Kinshasa and based on our data, circulation is more important than previously reported. Furthermore, our study shows that the prescription of antibiotics, both antibacterial and antimalarial drugs, is rampant. Studies like this one, elucidating the causes of acute fever, may lead to a more considerate and rigorous use of antibiotics. This will not only stem the ever-increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance, but will-ultimately and hopefully-improve the clinical care of outpatients in low-resource settings.Author summary Malaria remains one of the most important causes of fever in sub-Saharan Africa. However, its share is declining, since the diagnosis and treatment of malaria have improved significantly over the years. Hence leading to an increase in the number of patients presenting with non-malarial fever. Often, obvious clinical signs and symptoms like cough or diarrhea are absent, probing the question: ""What causes the fever?"" Previous studies have shown that the burden of arboviral infections-like dengue and chikungunya-in sub-Saharan Africa is underestimated, which is why we screened for four common arboviral infections in patients presenting with 'undifferentiated fever' at an outpatient clinic in suburban Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. Among the patients tested, we found that one in ten presented with an acute arboviral infection and that almost one in three patients had been infected in the past. These findings suggest that clinicians should think about arboviral infections more often, thereby refraining from the prescription of antibiotics, a practice increasingly problematic given the global rise of antimicrobial resistance.",2019,,PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,13,9,,WOS:000490987100012,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007047,,#9224,Proesmans 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-07-27 01:29:31)(Select): reports zero zika cases.; ,
Spatial Analysis of Mosquito-Borne Diseases in Europe: A Scoping Review,"Moutinho, S; Rocha, J; Gomes, A; Gomes, B; Ribeiro, AI","Mosquito-borne infections are increasing in endemic areas and previously unaffected regions. In 2020, the notification rate for Dengue was 0.5 cases per 100,000 population, and for Chikungunya <0.1/100,000. In 2019, the rate for Malaria was 1.3/100,000, and for West Nile Virus, 0.1/100,000. Spatial analysis is increasingly used in surveillance and epidemiological investigation, but reviews about their use in this research topic are scarce. We identify and describe the methodological approaches used to investigate the distribution and ecological determinants of mosquito-borne infections in Europe. Relevant literature was extracted from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception until October 2021 and analysed according to PRISMA-ScR protocol. We identified 110 studies. Most used geographical correlation analysis (n = 50), mainly applying generalised linear models, and the remaining used spatial cluster detection (n = 30) and disease mapping (n = 30), mainly conducted using frequentist approaches. The most studied infections were Dengue (n = 32), Malaria (n = 26), Chikungunya (n = 26), and West Nile Virus (n = 24), and the most studied ecological determinants were temperature (n = 39), precipitation (n = 24), water bodies (n = 14), and vegetation (n = 11).

Association between Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection and Brain Injury in Neonates: A Meta-analysis of Cohort Studies,"Zhang, L; Li, ZK; Han, X; Du, HY; Cao, YL; Liu, YM; Wang, WF","Objective. To assess association between congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and brain injury in neonates. Methods. The literatures from inception to November 4, 2020, were searched through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Heterogeneity test was conducted for each indicator and measured by I2 statistics. If I2 >= 50%, the random effects model was applied; otherwise, the fixed effects model was used. Sensitivity analysis was performed for all models. Weighed mean difference (WMD) was used as the effect size for measurement data, and risk ratio (RR) was as the effect indicator. Results. A total of 13 studies, including 4,262 congenital CMV infection neonates, were enrolled in this study. Our results showed that the rate of hearing impairment (RR: 2.105, 95% CI: (1.115, 3.971), P=0.002), sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) (RR: 17.051, 95% CI: (6.201, 46.886), P<0.001), and microcephaly (RR: 2.283, 95% CI: (1.325, 3.935), P =0.003) in neonates infected congenital CMV was higher than that in control group. Conclusion. The risks of hearing impairment, SNHL, and microcephaly in neonates during childhood may be associated with congenital CMV infection.

About the need to address pediatric health inequalities in French Guiana : a scoping review,"Osei, L; Basurko, C; Nacher, M; Vignier, N; Elenga, N","Introduction: French Guiana is a French overseas territory in South America, marked by poverty and inequal-ities. Access to different services, including healthcare, is unequal depending on where people live. Several studies showed that among adults, the most precarious individuals had greater incidences of chronic and infectious diseases. Although the median age of the population living in this territory is 25, there is no specific focus on the pediatric population although it is documented that socioeconomic inequalities have an impact on child health. The objective of this scoping review is to shed light on health challenges concerning children living in French Guiana. Methods: A literature search was performed on PubMed to identify relevant articles, and additional referen-ces were added if within the scope of this review. Results: A total of 106 publications were reviewed. Perinatal health issues were linked to a high rate of teen-age pregnancies with poor medical follow-up leading to complications such as preterm deliveries and con -genital malformations and abnormalities. Infectious diseases were a significant burden with worrisome vaccination coverage figures for some bacterial infections, partly explaining a high mortality rate attributable to infectious diseases. Herbicide poisoning with paraquat was reported in children, and environment-related concerns such as wild animal attacks as well as lead and mercury exposure were reported. Some children liv-ing in remote Amerindian communities had a higher suicide rate than in mainland France, and chronic dis-eases such as sickle cell disease were reported to have more transfusion-related complications. Conclusion: Children living in French Guiana have worse pediatric health indicators in comparison with chil-dren from mainland France. .(c) 2022 French Society of Pediatrics.

Vertical transmission of Zika virus and its outcomes: a Bayesian synthesis of prospective studies.,Ades AE; Soriano-Arandes A; Alarcon A; Bonfante F; Thorne C; Peckham CS; Giaquinto C,"BACKGROUND: Prospective studies of Zika virus in pregnancy have reported rates of congenital Zika syndrome and other adverse outcomes by trimester. However, Zika virus can infect and damage the fetus early in utero, but clear before delivery. The true vertical transmission rate is therefore unknown. We aimed to provide the first estimates of underlying vertical transmission rates and adverse outcomes due to congenital infection with Zika virus by trimester of exposure. METHODS: This was a Bayesian latent class analysis of data from seven prospective studies of Zika virus in pregnancy. We estimated vertical transmission rates, rates of Zika-virus-related and non-Zika-virus-related adverse outcomes, and the diagnostic sensitivity of markers of congenital infection. We allowed for variation between studies in these parameters and used information from women in comparison groups with no PCR-confirmed infection, where available. FINDINGS: The estimated mean risk of vertical transmission was 47% (95% credible interval 26 to 76) following maternal infection in the first trimester, 28% (15 to 46) in the second, and 25% (13 to 47) in the third. 9% (4 to 17) of deliveries following infections in the first trimester had symptoms consistent with congenital Zika syndrome, 3% (1 to 7) in the second, and 1% (0 to 3) in the third. We estimated that in infections during the first, second, and third trimester, respectively, 13% (2 to 27), 3% (-5 to 14), and 0% (-7 to 11) of pregnancies had adverse outcomes attributable to Zika virus infection. Diagnostic sensitivity of markers of congenital infection was lowest in the first trimester (42% [18 to 72]), but increased to 85% (51 to 99) in trimester two, and 80% (42 to 99) in trimester three. There was substantial between-study variation in the risks of vertical transmission and congenital Zika syndrome. INTERPRETATION: This preliminary analysis recovers the causal effects of Zika virus from disparate study designs. Higher transmission in the first trimester is unusual with congenital infections but accords with laboratory evidence of decreasing susceptibility of placental cells to infection during pregnancy.

The Armed Services Blood Program (ASBP) tested blood using its own protocol concurrently with the IND study sponsored by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., titled ""A Prospective Study to Evaluate the Specificity of the cobas Zika test for use on the cobas 6800/8800 System for Screening of Blood Donations for the Presence of Zika virus RNA."" STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective clinical trial (September 2016-August 2017) evaluated the specificity of the cobas Zika 6800/8800 System. Consenting volunteers were screened for Zika by participating reference labs. Participants with positive screens were offered a follow-up study using alternative PCR and serology assays. RESULTS: 92,618 DoD donors enrolled; four tested positive on screening (0.0043%; CI 0.001176896%, 0.01105894%). Three enrolled in follow-up testing and none were positive. These results were comparable to all U.S. donors: 3,858,114 enrolled (excluding Puerto Rico) with 459 positive screens (0.0119%; CI 0.01083582%, 0.01303962%). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the effectiveness of the cobas Zika test.

Ophthalmological manifestations in congenital Zika syndrome in 469 Brazilian children.,Ventura CV; Zin A; Paula Freitas B; Ventura LO; Rocha C; Costa F; Nery N Jr; De Senna TCR; Lopes Moreira ME; Maia M; Belfort R Jr,"PURPOSE: To analyze the spectrum of ophthalmologic manifestations in a large sample of children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in Brazil. METHODS: The medical records of infants born in the states of Pernambuco, Bahia, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between December 2015 and December 2016 with clinical manifestations of CZS and positive reverse transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) and/or serology for the Zika virus were reviewed retrospectively. Data were collected from the record of the first ophthalmological assessment, performed on admission. Children with other congenital infectious diseases, genetic conditions, and incomplete medical records were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 469 infants (242 female [51.6%]) were included. Mean age at examination was 5.0 ± 7.1 months (range, 0.0-36.0 months). Of the 469 infants, 197 (42.0%) were from Rio de Janeiro, 144 (30.7%) from Pernambuco, and 128 (27.3%) from Bahia States. Microcephaly at birth was detected in 214 (45.6%) children; 62 cases (29.0%) were severe. Pernambuco had significantly more children born with microcephaly compared with Bahia and Rio de Janeiro (P < 0.001). Ocular manifestations were found in 269 of 938 eyes (28.7%; 148/469 children [31.6%]). The main ocular alterations were optic nerve pallor in 122 of 938 eyes (13.0%), focal pigment mottling in 112 eyes (11.9%), and chorioretinal scars in 101 eyes (10.8%).

Zika Virus: Relevance to the State of Hawai'i.,Lew WJ; Tsai WY; Balaraman V; Liow KK; Tyson J; Wang WK,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is spread among human populations primarily through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes. While most ZIKV infections are asymptomatic or cause self-limited symptoms, the major concerns are its association with Guillain-Barré Syndrome and fetal microcephaly together with other birth defects, known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). This article reviews the confirmed Zika cases in the continental United States (U.S.) and Hawai'i thus far, as well as literature of Zika research relevant to Hawai'i. The first case of CZS within the U.S. was reported in Hawai'i, highlighting the unique position of Hawai'i for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Recent studies of the Zika outbreak in Florida demonstrate the key role of Ae. aegypti mosquito in transmission; continuous and proactive vector surveillance in Hawai'i is warranted. Additionally, an updated interim pregnancy guidance for pregnant women with possible ZIKV exposure was summarized. Due to recent decline of ZIKV transmission in the Americas, the risk of ZIKV importation to Hawai'i has been greatly reduced. However, given the presence of Aedes mosquitoes, climate condition, and status of Hawai'i as a travel destination and foreign import market, public health officials and healthcare providers should remain vigilant for a potential outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases in the future.",2019,Apr,Hawaii J Med Public Health,78,4,123-127,,,30972234,#9984,Lew 2019,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,
Evolutionary History and Genetic Variation of Zika Virus: Connection Between Thailand Zika Viruses and Global Outbreaks Strains.,Bahoussi AN; Shah PT; Liu Y; Guo YY; Bu H; Wu C; Xing L,"Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) has significant potential to cause future outbreaks due to insufficient countermeasures. The evolution of ZIKV in Southeast Asian countries remains poorly understood. Materials and Methods: The phylogenetic, phylogeographic network, and recombination analyses of 366 ZIKV complete genome sequences identified between 1947 and 2021 were performed and the amino acid variation landscape was determined to reveal the evolutionary characteristics. Results: ZIKV falls into two major genogroups: GI and GII, segregated into further subgenogroups (GI-1 to GI-3) and (GII-1 to GII-3), respectively. Importantly, Thailand strains cluster with Southeast Asian outbreak strains (Singapore 2016, the Philippines 2012, Cambodia 2010) into GII-2 and form a lineage independent of French Polynesia and the Americas large outbreak strains. Thailand ZIKV strains shared their ancestral route to the strains from French Polynesia, which further connects to Brazil ZIKV through a short mutational branch. Both recombination and specific mutations may contribute to the emergence of new virus lineage in Thailand. Conclusion: This report provides insights into the evolutionary characteristics of ZIKV in Southeast Asia, which may be helpful for epidemiological investigation, vaccine development, and surveillance of the virus.",2024,Feb,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,24,2,122-128,,10.1089/vbz.2023.0037,37890113,#9995,Bahoussi 2024,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-03-21 22:53:47)(Screen): mutation/substitution rates?; ,
Early Predictors of Poor Neurologic Outcomes in a Prospective Cohort of Infants With Antenatal Exposure to Zika Virus.,Tiene SF; Cranston JS; Nielsen-Saines K; Kerin T; Fuller T; Vasconcelos Z; Marschik PB; Zhang D; Pone M; Pone S; Zin A; Brickley E; Orofino D; Brasil P; Adachi K; da Costa ACC; Lopes Moreira ME,"BACKGROUND: Identify early predictors of poor neurodevelopment in infants with antenatal Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure. METHODS: Analysis of a prospective cohort of infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure confirmed by maternal or infant RT-PCR or IgM during the epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Clinical findings before 3 months of age were associated with Bayley-III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development conducted after 6 months of age. RESULTS: ZIKV exposure was confirmed in 219 cases; 162 infants were normocephalic, 53 were microcephalic, 4 had no head circumference recorded because of perinatal death/LTFU. Seven of the 112 normocephalic infants developed secondary microcephaly between 3 weeks and 8 months of age. Among the normocephalic at birth cohort, the mean HCZ among normal, at risk, and developmentally delayed children was significantly different (ANOVA, P = 0.02). In particular, the mean HCZ of the developmentally delayed group was significantly lower than that of the normal group (Tukey's test, P = 0.014). HCZ was more strongly associated with lower expressive language scores (P = 0.04) than receptive language scores (P = 0.06). The rate of auditory abnormalities differed among the normal, at risk, and developmentally delayed groups (Chi-squared test, P = 0.016), which was driven by the significant difference between the normal and at risk groups (post hoc test, P = 0.011, risk ratio 3.94). Auditory abnormalities were associated with both expressive and receptive language delays (P = 0.02 and P = 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Clear predictors of neurodevelopment in normocephalic ZIKV-exposed children have not been previously identified. Our findings demonstrate that smaller HCZ and auditory abnormalities in these infants correlate with poor neurodevelopment as toddlers.

METHOD OF STUDY: In this observational, prospective cohort study, we recruited pregnant women presenting for prenatal ultrasound for ZIKV exposure at a single academic teaching hospital in Boston, MA from November 2016 to December 2018. We collected blood, urine, and cervicovaginal swabs antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum; and cord blood and placenta at delivery. We used experimental assays to calculate quantitative viral loads, ZIKV-specific immunoglobulin titers, and ZIKV-specific T-cell responses. RESULTS: We enrolled 22 participants, three of which had serologic-confirmed ZIKV infection. No participants demonstrated sustained ZIKV shedding. ZIKV-specific IgG/IgM antibody was sustained throughout pregnancy and postpartum. ZIKV envelope and capsid-specific T-cell responses were also observed, albeit inconsistent. No newborns in this cohort had congenital Zika syndrome. Infant cord blood of infected mothers exhibited ZIKV-specific IgG, but not IgM antibodies. CONCLUSION: We detected a robust, prolonged maternal humoral immune response to ZIKV during pregnancy and postpartum. We also demonstrated evidence for efficient transplacental antibody transfer from mother to infant at birth, supporting the importance of neonatal passive immunity to ZIKV.

Bayesian phylogeography methods were applied to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of ZIKV in the Americas and with more detail inside Brazil. Our analyses reconstructed the Brazilian state of Pernambuco as the likely point of introduction of ZIKV in Brazil, possibly during the 2013 Confederations Cup. Pernambuco played an important role in spreading the virus to other Brazilian states. Our results also underscore the long cryptic circulation of ZIKV in all analyzed locations in Brazil.

A qualitative study of community perspectives surrounding cleaning practices in the context of Zika prevention in El Salvador: implications for community-based Aedes aegypti control.,Leontsini E; Maloney S; Ramírez M; Rodriguez E; Gurman T; Ballard Sara A; Hunter GC,"BACKGROUND: In El Salvador, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes transmitting Zika and other arboviruses use water storage containers as important oviposition sites. Promotion of water storage container cleaning is a key element of prevention programs. We explored community perceptions surrounding cleaning practices among pregnant women, male partners of pregnant women, and women likely to become pregnant. METHODS: Researchers conducted 11 focus groups and 12 in-depth interviews which included individual elicitations of Zika prevention measures practiced in the community. Focus group participants rated 18 images depicting Zika-related behaviors according to effectiveness and feasibility in the community context, discussed influencing determinants, voted on community intentions to perform prevention behaviors, and performed washbasin cleaning simulations. In-depth interviews with male partners of pregnant women used projective techniques with images to explore their perceptions on a subset of Zika prevention behaviors. RESULTS: General cleaning of the home, to ensure a healthy environment, was a strong community norm. In this context, participants gave water storage container cleaning a high rating, for both its effectiveness and feasibility. Participants were convinced that they cleaned their water storage containers effectively against Zika, but their actual skills were inadequate to destroy Aedes aegypti eggs. A further constraint was the schedule of water availability. Even during pregnancy, male partners rarely cleaned water storage containers because water became available in homes when they were at work. Furthermore, prevailing gender norms did not foster male participation in domestic cleaning activities. Despite these factors, many men were willing to provide substantial support with cleaning when their partners were pregnant, in order to protect their family. CONCLUSIONS: Behavior change programs for the prevention of Zika and other arboviruses need to improve community members' mosquito egg destruction skills rather than perpetuate the promotion of non-specific cleaning in and around the home as effective. Egg elimination must be clearly identified as the objective of water storage container maintenance and programs should highlight the effective techniques to achieve this goal. In addition, programs must build the skills of family members who support pregnant women to maintain the frequency of effective egg destruction in all water storage containers of the home.",2020,Sep,BMC Public Health,20,1,1385,,10.1186/s12889-020-09370-5,32912177,#10266,Leontsini 2020,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Postnatal symptomatic Zika virus infections in children and adolescents: A systematic review.,Ramond A; Lobkowicz L; Clemente NS; Vaughan A; Turchi MD; Wilder-Smith A; Brickley EB,"BACKGROUND: Recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks in the Pacific and the Americas have highlighted clinically significant congenital neurological abnormalities resulting from ZIKV infection in pregnancy. However, little is known about ZIKV infections in children and adolescents, a group that is potentially vulnerable to ZIKV neurovirulence. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on the clinical presentation and complications of children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years with a robust diagnosis of ZIKV infection. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, LILACs, and EMBASE until 13 February 2020 and screened reference lists of eligible articles. We assessed the studies' risk of bias using pre-specified criteria. FINDINGS: Our review collated the evidence from 2543 pediatric ZIKV cases representing 17 countries and territories, identified in 1 cohort study, 9 case series and 22 case reports. The most commonly observed signs and symptoms of ZIKV infection in children and adolescents were mild and included fever, rash, conjunctivitis and arthralgia. The frequency of neurological complications was reported only in the largest case series (identified in 1.0% of cases) and in an additional 14 children identified from hospital-based surveillance studies and case reports. ZIKV-related mortality was primarily accompanied by co-morbidity and was reported in one case series (<0.5% of cases) and three case reports. One death was attributed to complications of Guillain-Barré Syndrome secondary to ZIKV infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Based on the current evidence, the clinical presentation of ZIKV infection in children and adolescents appears to be primarily mild and similar to the presentation in adults, with rare instances of severe complications and/or mortality. However, reliable estimation of the risks of ZIKV complications in these age groups is limited by the scarcity and quality of published data. Additional prospective studies are needed to improve understanding of the relative frequency of the signs, symptoms, and complications associated with pediatric ZIKV infections and to investigate any potential effects of early life ZIKV exposure on neurodevelopment.",2020,Oct,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,14,10,e0008612,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008612,33006989,#10272,Ramond 2020,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Molecular characterization and geographical distribution of Zika virus worldwide from 1947 to 2022.,Noisumdaeng P; Dangsagul W; Sangsiriwut K; Prasertsopon J; Changsom D; Yoksan S; Ajawatanawong P; Buathong R; Puthavathana P,"OBJECTIVES: We conducted molecular characterization, demonstrated the geographical distribution of Zika virus (ZIKV) circulating worldwide from 1947 to 2022 and explored the potential genetic recombination site in the Thailand ZIKV genomes. METHODS: We constructed phylogenetic trees based on ZIKV coding sequences (CDS) and determined the geographical distribution of the representative viruses by genetic relationship and timeline. We determined genetic recombination among ZIKV and between ZIKV and other flaviviruses using similarity plot and bootscan analyzes, together with the phylogeny encompassing the CDS and eight subgenomic regions. RESULTS: The phylogenetic trees comprising 717 CDS showed two distinct African and Asian lineages. ZIKV in the African lineage formed two sublineages, and ZIKV in the Asian lineage diversified into the Asian and American sublineages. The 1966 Malaysian isolate was designated the prototype of the Asian sublineage and formed a node of only one member, while the newer viruses formed a distinct node. We detected no genetic recombination in the Thailand ZIKV. CONCLUSION: Five Thailand isolates discovered in 2006 were the second oldest ZIKV after the Malaysian prototype. Our result suggested two independent routes of ZIKV spread from Southeast Asia to Micronesia in 2007 and French Polynesia in 2013 before further spreading to South American countries.",2023,Nov,Int J Infect Dis,136,,05-Oct,,10.1016/j.ijid.2023.08.023,37652092,#10292,Noisumdaeng 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Neurodevelopmental outcome of infants without central nervous system anomalies born to symptomatic RT-PCR ZIKV positive women.,Díaz-Martínez LA; Rojas MA; Pinilla-García LS; Becerra-Mojica CH; Pérez-Vera LA; Gutiérrez-Sánchez LÁ; Contreras-García GA; Rueda-Ordoñez CG; Villar L,"An epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection began in Colombia in October 2015. Previous studies have identified a cause-effect relationship between fetal exposure to the ZIKV and the development of microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) anomalies with variable degrees of neurodevelopmental delay. Less is known about the neurodevelopmental outcome of infants without CNS anomalies born to symptomatic ZIKV RT-PCR-positive women. We aimed to compare the neurodevelopmental outcome of these infants to a control group of infants without CNS anomalies born to asymptomatic ZIKV RT-PCR negative women who did not seroconvert during pregnancy. Participating infants were categorized according to ZIKV maternal exposure. Women with symptomatology suggestive of ZIKV infection and a positive RT-PCR for ZIKV were categorized as ZIKV-exposed. Maternal controls (ZIKV unexposed) from the same geographic area were subsequently captured during the tail end of the epidemic through a partner project, the ZIKAlliance, whose aim was to determine the prevalence of ZIKV in pregnant women. Infant survivors from these two groups of pregnant women had a neurodevelopmental evaluation at 12, 18, and 24 months corrected age (CA). The ZIKV-exposed women were found to be older, had less subsidized health care, had a higher percentage of women in middle-class socioeconomic strata, had higher technical and university education, were less likely to be living with a partner, and had higher rates of pregnancy comorbidity and premature births than ZIKV unexposed women. Compared to infants born to ZIKV unexposed women (unexposed), infants born to ZIKV exposed women (exposed) were of lower gestational age and required more speech and occupational therapy services. No differences between groups were observed in the proportion of cut-off scores <70 on the Bayley-III Scale at 12, 18, and 24 months for motor, language, and cognitive domains. When a cut-off of <85 was used, a higher percentage of motor and cognitive impairment was observed in unexposed infants at 12 and 24 months CA, respectively. Median and IQR score on the Bayley-III scale showed higher scores in favor of exposed infants for motor development at 12 and 18 months CA, language at 12 months, and cognitive domain at 12, 18, and 24 months. The adjusted median and IQR compound score of the difference between exposed and unexposed was higher in favor of exposed infants at 12 to 24 months CA for motor (3.8 [95% CI 1.0 to 6.7]) and cognitive domains (10.6 [95% CI 7.3 to 13.9]). We observed no differences in the language domain (1.9 [95% CI -1.2 to 5.0]). We conclude that infants with no evidence of microcephaly or other CNS anomalies born to ZIKV-exposed women had normal neurodevelopment up to 24 months of CA, supporting an all-or-nothing effect with maternal ZIKV exposure.

Congenital Zika syndrome.,Crisanto-López IE; Jesús PL; López-Quecho J; Flores-Alonso JC,"In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika virus (ZIKV) infection a public health emergency of international concern because it caused congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The CZS is considered a specific pattern of birth defects caused by ZIKV infection, which is transmitted by the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The CZS clinical manifestations are broad and nonspecific, including microcephaly, subcortical calcifications, ocular alterations, congenital contractures, early hypertonia, and pyramidal as well as extrapyramidal symptoms. The ZIKV has gained great importance because it has affected a large percentage of the population worldwide during the last few years, despite the measures implemented by international organizations. The pathophysiology and non-vectorial transmission routes of the virus are still under study. The diagnosis is made upon suspicion of ZIKV infection, the patient's clinical manifestations, and it is confirmed by molecular laboratory tests demonstrating the presence of viral particles. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment or vaccine for this condition; however, patients receive multidisciplinary care and constant monitoring. Therefore, the strategies that have been implemented are directed toward preventive measures and vector control.",2023,,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,80,1,Mar-14,,10.24875/BMHIM.22000110,36867568,#10335,Crisanto-López 2023,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-03-24 22:21:25)(Screen): review; ,Review
Disease burden of congenital Zika virus syndrome in Brazil and its association with socioeconomic data.,de Amorin Vilharba BL; Yamamura M; de Azevedo MV; Fernandes WS; Santos-Pinto CDB; de Oliveira EF,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection became a global public health concern, causing an epidemic in Latin America from 2015 to 2016, when a sudden increase in cases of microcephaly and other congenital anomalies was observed. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization defined congenital Zika-associated syndrome (CZS) as a set of congenital anomalies seen in children born to mothers with a history of gestational Zika fever, who have microcephaly as the most prevalent clinical sign. In order to describe the magnitude of CZS in Brazil, this study estimated the burden of disease due to CZS in Brazil using the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) indicator and other frequency measures, such as incidence and mortality rate, during the years 2015-2020. The association of these indicators with socioeconomic variables was also evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Choropleth maps were used to evaluate the spatial distribution of the indicators evaluated and the spatial autocorrelation was verified by the Bivariate Moran Local Index. From 2015 to 2020, 3,591 cases of CZS were confirmed in Brazil, with an incidence of 44.03 cases per 1000 live births, and a specific mortality of 12.35 deaths per 1000 live births. A global loss of 30,027.44 DALYs was estimated from 2015 to 2020. The Northeast region had the highest values for all health indicators assessed. Spatial correlation and autocorrelation analyses showed significant associations between health and socioeconomic indicators, such as per capita income, Gini index, illiteracy rate and basic sanitation. The study allowed us to have access to all reported cases of CZS, showing us the possible situation of the disease in Brazil; therefore, we believe that our results can help in the understanding of future studies.",2023,Jul,Sci Rep,13,1,11882,,10.1038/s41598-023-38553-4,37482558,#10358,deAmorinVilharba 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-10-26 23:25:51)(Select): correlation rather than risk factors; Extractor (2024-08-05 19:04:58)(Select): Risk factors; ,
Neurodevelopmental outcomes in congenital and perinatal infections.,Fortin O; Mulkey SB,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Congenital infections are a major cause of childhood multidomain neurodevelopmental disabilities. They contribute to a range of structural brain abnormalities that can cause severe neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and neurosensory impairments. New congenital infections and global viral pandemics have emerged, with some affecting the developing brain and causing neurodevelopmental concerns. This review aims to provide current understanding of fetal infections and their impact on neurodevelopment. RECENT FINDINGS: There are a growing list of congenital infections causing neurodevelopmental issues, including cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, syphilis, rubella, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and toxoplasmosis. Fetal exposure to maternal SARS-CoV-2 may also pose risk to the developing brain and impact neurodevelopmental outcomes, although studies have conflicting results. As Zika virus was a recently identified congenital infection, there are several new reports on child neurodevelopment in the Caribbean and Central and South America. For many congenital infections, children with in-utero exposure, even if asymptomatic at birth, may have neurodevelopmental concerns manifest over time. SUMMARY: Congenital infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child with neurodevelopmental impairments. Detailed pregnancy history, exposure risk, and testing should guide diagnosis and multidisciplinary evaluation. Children with congenital infections should have long-term follow-up to assess for neurodevelopmental delays and other neurosensory impairments. Children with confirmed delays or high-risk should be referred for rehabilitation therapies.",2023,Oct,Curr Opin Infect Dis,36,5,405-413,,10.1097/QCO.0000000000000946,37466092,#10360,Fortin 2023,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
"Epidemiological profile of arboviruses in two different scenarios: dengue circulation vs. dengue, chikungunya and Zika co-circulation.",Farias PCS; Pastor AF; Gonçales JP; do Nascimento IDS; de Souza Ferraz ES; Lopes TRR; do Carmo RF; Côelho MRCD; Silva Júnior JVJ,"BACKGROUND: The severity and distribution of dengue virus (DENV) infections have been attributed to a complex interaction among viral, host and environmental factors. Herein, we investigated the influence of chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses on the epidemiological profile of dengue cases, using Recife, Pernambuco state, Brazil, as a study model. In addition, we described and compared the epidemiological profile related to each arbovirus (DENV vs. CHIKV vs. ZIKV). METHODS: All cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika reported to the Pernambuco Health Department in 2011-2013 (DENV circulation) and 2016-2018 (DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV co-circulation) were included in our study. The cases were classified by sex, age and race/color and their distribution was analyzed by the χ(2) test. Furthermore, the data were also analyzed for co-infections. Temperature, humidity and rainfall data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and paired t-test. RESULTS: During 2011-2013, 15,315 dengue cases were diagnosed, most of them female, brown and 20-29 age group. Between 2016 and 2018, 15,870 dengue cases were described, which presented the same profile described above. In the two triennia, the female/male dengue ratio fluctuated significantly, ranging from 1.07 to 1.52. Regarding chikungunya, 7076 cases were reported, most of them female and brown. The female/male ratio also fluctuated significantly, ranging from 1.62 to 2.1. Two main age groups were observed in chikungunya: ≤ 19 years (minority of diagnoses) and ≥ 20 years (majority of diagnoses). In the same triennium, 266 Zika cases were reported to the Pernambuco Health Department, mainly in females and in the 0-9 and 20-39 age groups. In general, 119 co-infections were identified: 117 DENV-CHIKV, 1 CHIKV-ZIKV and 1 DENV-CHIKV-ZIKV. Concerning climate data, only the humidity in 2011 was significantly different from the other years. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological profile of dengue cases did not change after the introduction of CHIKV and ZIKV. Females were the most diagnosed with dengue, chikungunya or Zika, however we found important differences in the age profile of these arboviruses, which should be considered by public health policies, as well as investigated in future studies of virus-host interaction.",2023,Mar,BMC Infect Dis,23,1,177,,10.1186/s12879-023-08139-6,36949383,#10370,FariasPCS 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-05-30 01:41:32)(Select): outbreak; ,
Genetic diversity and phylogenetic analyses of Asian lineage Zika virus whole genome sequences derived from Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes and urine of patients during the 2020 epidemic in Thailand.,Phumee A; Chitcharoen S; Sutthanont N; Intayot P; Wacharapluesadee S; Siriyasatien P,"Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has been continually emerging and re-emerging since 2010, with sporadic cases reported annually in Thailand, peaking at over 1000 confirmed positive cases in 2016. Leveraging high-throughput sequencing technologies, specifically whole genome sequencing (WGS), has facilitated rapid pathogen genome sequencing. In this study, we used multiplex amplicon sequencing on the Illumina Miseq instrument to describe ZIKV WGS. Six ZIKV WGS were derived from three samples of field-caught Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes (two males and one female) and three urine samples collected from patients in three different provinces of Thailand. Additionally, successful isolation of a ZIKV isolate occurred from a female Cx. quinquefasciatus. The WGS analysis revealed a correlation between the 2020 outbreak and the acquisition of five amino acid changes in the Asian lineage ZIKV strains from Thailand (2006), Cambodia (2010 and 2019), and the Philippines (2012). These changes, including C-T106A, prM-V1A, E-V473M, NS1-A188V, and NS5-M872V, were identified in all seven WGS, previously linked to significantly higher mortality rates. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the seven ZIKV sequences belonged to the Asian lineage. Notably, the genomic region of the E gene showed the highest nucleotide diversity (0.7-1.3%). This data holds significance in informing the development of molecular tools that enhance our understanding of virus patterns and evolution. Moreover, it may identify targets for improved methods to prevent and control future ZIKV outbreaks.",2023,Oct,Sci Rep,13,1,18470,,10.1038/s41598-023-45814-9,37891235,#10428,Phumee 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-07-27 01:25:38)(Select): can't find any mutation rates; ,

Burden of disease due to microcephaly associated with the Zika virus in Colombia.,Mora-Salamanca AF; Porras-Ramírez A; Restrepo FPH,"In 2015, the Zika virus was introduced in Colombia. The emergence of this arbovirus is a public health challenge for the country, considering the association between the infection and congenital disorders such as microcephaly. Thus, we estimated the burden of disease due to microcephaly associated with Zika in Colombia and its administrative subdivisions for the period 2015-2016. We conducted an exploratory ecological study, using as unit of measurement disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The cases of microcephaly were obtained from the Zika national and departmental databases built by the National Public Health Surveillance System (SIVIGILA). Deaths attributed to microcephaly were estimated from previous studies. Finally, we calculated mortality rates and incidences, then we performed a sensitivity analysis under three scenarios (conservative, medium, and extreme) to estimate the DALYs. In the 2015-2016 period, 10,609.4 DALYs were caused by microcephaly associated with Zika in Colombia. 71% of the total DALYs were years of life lost and 29% were years lived with disability. Five out of 32 departments (Meta, Córdoba, Tolima, Valle del Cauca, and Norte de Santander) contributed 71% of total DALYs. The burden of microcephaly associated with Zika outweighed the burden of other congenital anomalies such as neural tube defects and Down syndrome in children aged between 0 and 4 years in Colombia.

We aimed to study the clinical difference of ZIKV disease among suspected non-severe DENV patients comparing children and adults. Patients with acute illness suspected of DENV disease plus no evidence of plasma leakage at the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Nonthaburi, Thailand, were enrolled from December 2016 to September 2018. Clinical data including DENV rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results were collected. Zika virus diagnosis was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR on urine. Of 291 (180 pediatric and 111 adult) cases enrolled, 27 (10 pediatric and 17 adult) confirmed ZIKV cases were found.

Zika Virus: A Brief History and Review of Its Pathogenesis Rediscovered.,Maslow JN; Roberts CC,"From its discovery in Uganda in 1947, Zika virus (ZIKV) was considered a relatively innocuous viral pathogen with sporadic and infrequent occurrence of human infection. It was during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2014 when cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome were identified as a serious complication of ZIKV infection in adults. However, in 2015, ZIKV emerged into and swept through South and Central America infecting millions of people. As part of the latter ZIKV outbreak, in Brazil, cases of microcephaly and other serious congenital complications affecting a large fraction of infants born to mothers infected during pregnancy were first identified and linked to ZIKV.

Oral alterations in children with microcephaly associated to congenital Zika syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analyses.,Silva LVO; Hermont AP; Magnani IQ; Martins CC; Borges-Oliveira AC,"AIMS: To synthesize the oral alterations observed in children with microcephaly associated with congenital Zika virus syndrome (CZS), and to compare the oral alterations of these children to a normotypic healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: A search was performed in six electronic databases. Observational studies published that reported oral alterations in children with CZS were selected. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed study quality, using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist tools, and the certainty of evidence, using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Twenty-one studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled crude occurrence showed 88% of increased salivation (95%CI: 82%-94%), 83% of biofilm (95%CI: 75%-91%), and 73% of bruxism (95%CI: 52%-95%).

Identifying possible inaccuracy in reported birth head circumference measurements among infants in the US Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry.,Roth NM; Woodworth KR; Godfred-Cato S; Delaney AM; Olson SM; Nahabedian JF 3rd; Reynolds MR; Jones AM; Neelam V; Valencia-Prado M; Delgado-López C; Lee EH; Ellis EM; Lake-Burger H; Tonzel JL; Higgins CA; Chan RL; Tong VT; Gilboa SM; Cragan JD; Honein MA; Moore CA,"BACKGROUND: The US Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry (USZPIR) monitors infants born to mothers with confirmed or possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy. The surveillance case definition for Zika-associated birth defects includes microcephaly based on head circumference (HC). METHODS: We assessed birth and follow-up data from infants with birth HC measurements <3rd percentile and birthweight ≥10th percentile to determine possible misclassification of microcephaly. We developed a schema informed by literature review and expert opinion to identify possible HC measurement inaccuracy using HC growth velocity and longitudinal HC measurements between 2 and 12 months of age. Two or more HC measurements were required for assessment. Inaccuracy in birth HC measurement was suspected if growth velocity was >3 cm/month in the first 3 months or HC was consistently >25th percentile during follow-up. RESULTS: Of 6,799 liveborn infants in USZPIR, 351 (5.2%) had Zika-associated birth defects, of which 111 had birth HC measurements <3rd percentile and birthweight ≥10th percentile. Of 84/111 infants with sufficient follow-up, 38/84 (45%) were classified as having possible inaccuracy of birth HC measurement, 19/84 (23%) had HC ≥3rd percentile on follow-up without meeting criteria for possible inaccuracy, and 27/84 (32%) had continued HC <3rd percentile. After excluding possible inaccuracies, the proportion of infants with Zika-associated birth defects including microcephaly decreased from 5.2% to 4.6%.

Another piece of the Zika puzzle: assessing the associated factors to microcephaly in a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Gallo LG; Martinez-Cajas J; Peixoto HM; Pereira ACEDS; Carter JE; McKeown S; Schaub B; Ventura CV; de França GVA; Pomar L; Ventura LO; Nerurkar VR; de Araújo WN; Velez MP,"BACKGROUND: Although it is known that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy may lead to microcephaly in the fetus, the prognostic factors associated with this tragic disorder remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prognostic factors associated with the incidence of microcephaly in congenital ZIKV infection. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE (R) Epub ahead of print, Embase, Embase Classic, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, LILACS, and various thesis databases to identify human studies reporting microcephaly associated with congenital ZIKV infection. We requested primary data from the authors of the included studies to calculate summary estimates and conduct the meta-analysis of the most prevalent factors. RESULTS: We screened 4106 titles and abstracts, and identified 12 studies for inclusion in the systematic review. The assessment of ZIKV infection and the definition of microcephaly varied among studies. A total of 6154 newborns/fetuses were enrolled; of those, 1120 (18.20%) had a diagnostic of ZIKV infection, of which 509 (45.45%) were diagnosed with microcephaly. Nine studies addressed the link between congenital ZIKV infection and neurological findings in newborns/fetuses. Half of the studies provided primary data. Three out of 11 factors of interest seem to be prognostic factors of microcephaly: infant's sex - males compared to females: Relative Risk (RR) 1.30, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) 1.14 to 1.49; the stage of pregnancy when infection occurred - infection in the first trimester of pregnancy compared to infection at other stages of pregnancy: RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.82; and asymptomatic infection compared to symptomatic infection during pregnancy: RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.77. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the female-biased resistance hypothesis and reinforce the risk associated with the stage of pregnancy when ZIKV infection occurs.

"Clinical manifestations of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in the Pacific Islands: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",Kharwadkar S; Herath N,"Dengue, Zika and chikungunya outbreaks pose a significant public health risk to Pacific Island communities. Differential diagnosis is challenging due to overlapping clinical features and limited availability of laboratory diagnostic facilities. There is also insufficient information regarding the complications of these arboviruses, particularly for Zika and chikungunya. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to calculate pooled prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the clinical manifestations of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in the Pacific Islands. Based on pooled prevalence estimates, clinical features that may help to differentiate between the arboviruses include headache, haemorrhage and hepatomegaly in dengue; rash, conjunctivitis and peripheral oedema in Zika; and the combination of fever and arthralgia in chikungunya infections. We estimated that the hospitalisation and mortality rates in dengue were 9.90% (95% CI 7.67-12.37) and 0.23% (95% CI 0.16-0.31), respectively. Severe forms of dengue occurred in 1.92% (95% CI 0.72-3.63) of reported cases and 23.23% (95% CI 13.58-34.53) of hospitalised patients. Complications associated with Zika virus included Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), estimated to occur in 14.08 (95% CI 11.71-16.66) per 10,000 reported cases, and congenital brain malformations such as microcephaly, particularly with first trimester maternal infection. For chikungunya, the hospitalisation rate was 2.57% (95% CI 1.30-4.25) and the risk of GBS was estimated at 1.70 (95% CI 1.06-2.48) per 10,000 reported cases. Whilst ongoing research is required, this systematic review enhances existing knowledge on the clinical manifestations of dengue, Zika and chikungunya infections and will assist Pacific Island clinicians during future arbovirus outbreaks.",2024,Mar,Rev Med Virol,34,2,e2521,,10.1002/rmv.2521,38340071,#10890,Kharwadkar 2024,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-03-16 03:14:01)(Screen): review; ,Review
Challenges of acute febrile illness diagnosis in a national infectious diseases center in Rio de Janeiro: 16-year experience of syndromic surveillance.,Bressan CDS; Teixeira MLB; Gouvêa MIFDS; de Pina-Costa A; Santos HFP; Calvet GA; Lupi O; Siqueira AM; Valls-de-Souza R; Valim C; Brasil P,"INTRODUCTION: Acute febrile illnesses (AFI) are a frequent chief complaint in outpatients. Because the capacity to investigate the causative pathogen of AFIs is limited in low- and middle-income countries, patient management may be suboptimal. Understanding the distribution of causes of AFI can improve patient outcomes. This study aims to describe the most common etiologies diagnosed over a 16-years period in a national reference center for tropical diseases in a large urban center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: From August 2004-December 2019, 3591 patients > 12 years old, with AFI and/or rash were eligible. Complementary exams for etiological investigation were requested using syndromic classification as a decision guide. Results. Among the 3591 patients included, endemic arboviruses such as chikungunya (21%), dengue (15%) and zika (6%) were the most common laboratory-confirmed diagnosis, together with travel-related malaria (11%). Clinical presumptive diagnosis lacked sensitivity for emerging diseases such as zika (31%). Rickettsia disease and leptospirosis were rarely investigated and an infrequent finding when based purely on clinical features. Respiratory symptoms increased the odds for the diagnostic remaining inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous patients did not have a conclusive etiologic diagnosis. Since syndromic classification used for standardization of etiological investigation and presumptive clinical diagnosis had moderate accuracy, it is necessary to incorporate new diagnostic technologies to improve diagnostic accuracy and surveillance capacity.",2023,Apr,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,17,4,e0011232,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0011232,37011087,#10894,BressanCDS 2023,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Microcephaly caused by or associated with congenital infections in the last 20 years in Brazil: a systematic review.,Quintans MDS; Bueno AC; Cardoso CAA,"This systematic review aimed to identify the pathogens causing or associated with congenital microcephaly in Brazil in the last 20 years due to the lack of official information by the Health Authorities and, as a consequence the uncertainty on the real infectious etiology of congenital microcephaly. A review protocol was prepared according to the PRISMA recommendation, using the PubMed, SciELO and LILACS databases to search for references presenting original data on microcephaly caused by or associated with congenital infectious in Brazil, using the descriptors ""MICROCEPHALY AND INFECTION"". The search ended on 30/Jun/2020. All selected titles were read in full and analyzed independently by the three reviewers. After searching the databases, 2,389 articles were selected for title review. Of these, 109 were excluded due to duplicates and 2,236 according to the criteria defined in the review. Only 44 met the eligibility criteria and were therefore read in full. Data extraction was performed on 10 articles, all published after 2015. Seven studies were literature reviews or case series, only two were case-control, and one was a cross-sectional study. As the studies focused on the period of the ZIKV epidemic in Brazil, the cases of congenital microcephaly between 2015 and 2017 were attributed to maternal infection by this virus when it was not possible to prove the presence of other etiological agents. Among the TORCH agents, a predominance of syphilis was observed. The analyzed studies did not add consistent information about the infectious causes or association of microcephaly in Brazil outside the period of ZIKV epidemic, revealing the need for more studies on the subject.",2022,,Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,64,,e7,,10.1590/S1678-9946202264007,35137901,#10916,QuintansMDS 2022,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

Serological Differences after Acute Zika Virus Infections between Children and Adults: Implication for Use of a Serological Test.,Wongsawat J; Suttha P; Chanama S; Srisopa S; Yonchoho N; Limpanadusadee P,"Information is limited regarding differential serological responses after acute Zika virus (ZIKV) infections and prevalence of cross-reactivity with anti-dengue virus (DENV) assays comparing children and adults. Early convalescent sera from a cohort of suspected mild DENV cases between December 2016 and September 2018 at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Thailand were tested for nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-based anti-ZIKV IgM and IgG ELISAs (Euroimmun), and in-house anti-DENV IgM- and IgG-capture ELISAs. ZIKV cases were identified by positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on urine.

The Burden of Arboviral Infections in the Military Health System 2012-2019.,Wellington T; Fraser JA; Kuo HC; Hickey PW; Lindholm DA,"Arboviral infections, including dengue (DNV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV), impact both travelers and native populations of endemic regions. We sought to assess the disease burden of arboviral infections in the Military Health System, the validity of arboviral diagnostic codes, and the role of pretravel counseling on insect avoidance precautions. We searched for diagnostic codes consistent with arboviral infection and grouped them into DNV, CHIKV, ZIKV, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and Other. Demographic data were evaluated. A subset of charts in each category were reviewed for diagnostic validity and travel characteristics. In all, 10,547 unique subjects carried 17,135 arboviral diagnostic codes, including 1,606 subjects (15.2%) coded for DNV, 230 (2.2%) for ZIKV, 65 (0.6%) for CHIKV, and 4,317 (40.9%) for JEV. A chart review was performed on 807 outpatient charts, yielding outpatient diagnostic code positive predictive values of 60.5% (DNV), 15.3% (ZIKV), and 64.5% (CHIKV); there were no valid cases of JEV. Dengue represented the greatest burden of arboviral infections with 2.2 cases per 100,000 military healthcare enrollees over the 2012-2019 fiscal years. More than 80% of subjects with arboviral infection did not have documented pretravel counseling. Arboviral infections represent a significant disease burden in young travelers to endemic regions. After adjustment for diagnostic validity, DNV represented the greatest burden. Diagnostic codes for ZIKV and JEV overestimate the burden of these diseases.

"Reassessment of the risk of birth defects due to Zika virus in Guadeloupe, 2016.",Funk AL; Hoen B; Vingdassalom I; Ryan C; Kadhel P; Schepers K; Gaete S; Tressières B; Fontanet A,"BACKGROUND: In the French Territories in the Americas (FTA), the risk of birth defects possibly associated with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was 7.0% (95%CI: 5.0 to 9.5) among foetuses/infants of 546 women with symptomatic RT-PCR confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy. Many of these defects were isolated measurement-based microcephaly (i.e. without any detected brain or clinical abnormalities) or mild neurological conditions. We wanted to estimate the proportion of such minor findings among live births of women who were pregnant in the same region during the outbreak period but who were not infected with ZIKV. METHODS: In Guadeloupe, pregnant women were recruited at the time of delivery and tested for ZIKV infection. The outcomes of live born infants of ZIKV non-infected women were compared to those of ZIKV-exposed live born infants in Guadeloupe, extracted from the FTA prospective cohort. RESULTS: Of 490 live born infants without exposure to ZIKV, 42 infants (8.6%, 95%CI: 6.2-11.4) had mild abnormalities that have been described as 'potentially linked to ZIKV infection'; all but one of these was isolated measurement-based microcephaly. Among the 241 live born infants with ZIKV exposure, the proportion of such abnormalities, using the same definition, was similar (6.6%, 95%CI: 3.8-10.6). CONCLUSIONS: Isolated anthropometric abnormalities and mild neurological conditions were as prevalent among infants with and without in-utero ZIKV exposure. If such abnormalities had not been considered as 'potentially linked to ZIKV' in the original prospective cohort in Guadeloupe, the overall estimate of the risk of birth defects considered due to the virus would have been significantly lower, at approximately 1.6% (95% CI: 0.4-4.1).

"Modelling the transmission of dengue, zika and chikungunya: a scoping review protocol.",Romero-Leiton JP; Acharya KR; Parmley JE; Arino J; Nasri B,"INTRODUCTION: Aedes mosquitoes are the primary vectors for the spread of viruses like dengue (DENV), zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV), all of which affect humans. Those diseases contribute to global public health issues because of their great dispersion in rural and urban areas. Mathematical and statistical models have become helpful in understanding these diseases' epidemiological dynamics. However, modelling the complexity of a real phenomenon, such as a viral disease, should consider several factors. This scoping review aims to document, identify and classify the most important factors as well as the modelling strategies for the spread of DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct searches in electronic bibliographic databases such as PubMed, MathSciNet and the Web of Science for full-text peer-reviewed articles written in English, French and Spanish. These articles should use mathematical and statistical modelling frameworks to study dengue, zika and chikungunya, and their cocirculation/coinfection with other diseases, with a publication date between 1 January 2011 and 31 July 2023. Eligible studies should employ deterministic, stochastic or statistical modelling approaches, consider control measures and incorporate parameters' estimation or considering calibration/validation approaches. We will exclude articles focusing on clinical/laboratory experiments or theoretical articles that do not include any case study. Two reviewers specialised in zoonotic diseases and mathematical/statistical modelling will independently screen and retain relevant studies. Data extraction will be performed using a structured form, and the findings of the study will be summarised through classification and descriptive analysis. Three scoping reviews will be published, each focusing on one disease and its cocirculation/co-infection with other diseases.

Here, we show the impact of environmental modifications on cases of infections by the dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses in humans in the state of Tocantins, Brazil, between the years 2010 and 2019. We conducted a descriptive and principal component analysis (PCA) to explore the main trends in environmental modifications and in the cases of human infections caused by these arboviruses in Tocantins. Our analysis demonstrated that the occurrence of El Niño, deforestation in the Cerrado and maximum temperatures had correlations with the cases of infections by the Zika virus between 2014 and 2016. El Niño, followed by La Niña, a gradual increase in precipitation and the maximum temperature observed between 2015 and 2017 were shown to have contributed to the infections by the chikungunya virus. La Niña and precipitation were associated with infections by the dengue virus between 2010 and 2012 and El Niño contributed to the 2019 outbreak observed within the state. By PCA, deforestation, temperatures and El Niño were the most important variables related to cases of dengue in humans.

"Dengue, chikungunya and zika arbovirus infections in Caribbean children.",Christie CDC; Lue AM; Melbourne-Chambers RH,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Dengue, chikungunya and zika have caused significant epidemics in the Caribbean in recent years. This review highlights their impact in Caribbean children. RECENT FINDINGS: Dengue has been increasingly intense and severe, seroprevalence is 80-100% in the Caribbean, children have increased attributable morbidity and mortality. Severe dengue, especially dengue with haemorrhage was significantly associated with haemoglobin SC disease and multiple organ-systems involved. These included the gastrointestinal and haematologic systems with extremely high lactate dehydrogenases and creatinine phosphokinases and severely abnormal bleeding indices. Despite appropriate interventions, mortality was highest within the first 48 h of admission. Chikungunya, a togavirus, affected 80% of some Caribbean populations. Paediatric presentations included high fever, skin, joint and neurological manifestations. Children less than 5 years of age had the highest morbidity and mortality. This maiden chikungunya epidemic was explosive and overwhelmed public health systems. Zika, another flavivirus, has a seroprevalence of 15% in pregnancy, so the Caribbean remains susceptible. Paediatric complications include pregnancy losses, stillbirths, Congenital Zika syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis. Neurodevelopment stimulation programs for zika-exposed infants have been effective in improving language and positive behaviour scores.

"Surveillance of Aedes aegypti populations in the city of Praia, Cape Verde: Zika virus infection, insecticide resistance and genetic diversity.",Campos M; Ward D; Morales RF; Gomes AR; Silva K; Sepúlveda N; Gomez LF; Clark TG; Campino S,"BACKGROUND: Aedes spp. are responsible for the transmission of many arboviruses, which contribute to rising human morbidity and mortality worldwide. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a main vector for chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever infections, whose incidence have been increasing and distribution expanding. This vector has also driven the emergence of the Zika virus (ZIKV), first reported in Africa which spread rapidly to Asia and more recently across the Americas. During the outbreak in the Americas, Cape Verde became the first African country declaring a Zika epidemic, with confirmed cases of microcephaly. Here we investigate the prevalence of ZIKV and dengue (DENV) infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in the weeks following the outbreak in Cape Verde, and the presence of insecticide resistance in the circulating vector population. Genetic diversity in the mosquito population was also analysed. METHODS: From August to October 2016, 816 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were collected in several locations across Praia, Cape Verde, the major hot spot of reported ZIKV cases in the country. All mosquitoes were screened by reverse transcription PCR for ZIKV and DENV, and a subset (n = 220) were screened for knockdown insecticide resistance associated mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene by capillary sequencing. The mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (nad4) gene was sequenced in 100 mosquitoes. These data were compared to 977 global sequences in a haplotype network and a phylogenetic tree analysis. RESULTS: Two Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were ZIKV positive (0.25%). There were no SNP mutations found in the VGSC gene associated with insecticide resistance. Analysis of the nad4 gene revealed 11 haplotypes in the Cape Verdean samples, with 5 being singletons. Seven haplotypes were exclusive to Cape Verde. Several of the remaining haplotypes were frequent in the global dataset, being present in several countries (including Cape Verde) across five different continents. The most common haplotype in Cape Verde (50.6 %) was also found in Africa and South America. CONCLUSIONS: There was low-level Zika virus circulation in mosquitoes from Praia shortly after the outbreak. The Ae. aegypti population did not appear to have the kdr mutations associated with pyrethroid resistance. Furthermore, haplotype and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Cape Verde Ae. aegypti mosquitoes are most closely related to those from other countries in Africa and South America.",2020,Sep,Parasit Vectors,13,1,481,,10.1186/s13071-020-04356-z,32958043,#11178,Campos 2020,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-05-30 02:00:06)(Select): do not see outbreak numbers; Extractor (2024-03-24 21:04:12)(Screen): mosquito-only but might report an outbreak ; ,
"Adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies with confirmed Zika Virus infection in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: A cohort study.",Souza JP; Méio MDBB; de Andrade LM; Figueiredo MR; Gomes Junior SC; Pereira Junior JP; Brickley E; Lopes Moreira ME,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes of Zika virus infection by the timing of infection during pregnancy. Method: Cohort study of 190 pregnancies with 193 offspring with a positive RT-PCR test for Zika virus (March/2016 to April/2017). RESULTS: Death or defects related to congenital Zika virus infection were identified in 37.3% of fetuses and newborns, and microcephaly in 21.4% of the newborns. The proportion of small for gestational age newborns was 21.9%. Maternal symptoms in the first trimester were significantly associated with the birth of newborns with microcephaly/cerebral atrophy, small for gestational age and with the deaths (one abortion, one stillbirth and the two neonatal deaths). Maternal infection during the second trimester was further associated with asymptomatic newborns at birth. The study showed that 58.5% of the offspring with microcephaly and / or cortical atrophy were small for gestational age, with an evident decrease in symptomatic offspring without microcephaly, 24.1%, and with only 9.1% in the asymptomatic group. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the earlier the symptoms appear during gestation, the more severe the endpoints.

"Spatio-temporal clusters and patterns of spread of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Colombia.",Freitas LP; Carabali M; Yuan M; Jaramillo-Ramirez GI; Balaguera CG; Restrepo BN; Zinszer K,"BACKGROUND: Colombia has one of the highest burdens of arboviruses in South America. The country was in a state of hyperendemicity between 2014 and 2016, with co-circulation of several Aedes-borne viruses, including a syndemic of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in 2015. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed the cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika notified in Colombia from January 2014 to December 2018 by municipality and week. The trajectory and velocity of spread was studied using trend surface analysis, and spatio-temporal high-risk clusters for each disease in separate and for the three diseases simultaneously (multivariate) were identified using Kulldorff's scan statistics. During the study period, there were 366,628, 77,345 and 74,793 cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, respectively, in Colombia. The spread patterns for chikungunya and Zika were similar, although Zika's spread was accelerated. Both chikungunya and Zika mainly spread from the regions on the Atlantic coast and the south-west to the rest of the country. We identified 21, 16, and 13 spatio-temporal clusters of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, respectively, and, from the multivariate analysis, 20 spatio-temporal clusters, among which 7 were simultaneous for the three diseases. For all disease-specific analyses and the multivariate analysis, the most-likely cluster was identified in the south-western region of Colombia, including the Valle del Cauca department.

"Using machine learning to understand microgeographic determinants of the Zika vector, Aedes aegypti.",Alexander J; Wilke ABB; Mantero A; Vasquez C; Petrie W; Kumar N; Beier JC,"There are limited data on why the 2016 Zika outbreak in Miami-Dade County, Florida was confined to certain neighborhoods. In this research, Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of Zika virus, are studied to examine neighborhood-level differences in their population dynamics and underlying processes. Weekly mosquito data were acquired from the Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control Division from 2016 to 2020 from 172 traps deployed around Miami-Dade County. Using random forest, a machine learning method, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics of Ae. aegypti in response to meteorological conditions and neighborhood-specific socio-demographic and physical characteristics, such as land-use and land-cover type and income level, were created. The study area was divided into two groups: areas affected by local transmission of Zika during the 2016 outbreak and unaffected areas. Ae. aegypti populations in areas affected by Zika were more strongly influenced by 14- and 21-day lagged weather conditions. In the unaffected areas, mosquito populations were more strongly influenced by land-use and day-of-collection weather conditions.

The malaria travellers' infection rate (TIR) was 28.8 cases per 100,000 travellers, which is 36 and 144 times higher than the TIR for dengue and chikungunya, respectively. The malaria TIR was highest among travellers arriving from Central and Western Africa. There were 956 and 161 diagnosed imported cases of dengue and chikungunya, respectively. The highest TIR was among travellers arriving from Central, Eastern and Western Africa for dengue and from Central Africa for chikungunya in this period. Limited numbers of cases of Zika virus disease, West Nile virus infection, Rift Valley fever and yellow fever were reported.ConclusionsDespite some limitations, travellers' health data can efficiently complement local surveillance data in Africa, particularly when the country or region has a sub-optimal surveillance system.

Zika virus detection in amniotic fluid and Zika-associated birth defects.,Mercado M; Ailes EC; Daza M; Tong VT; Osorio J; Valencia D; Rico A; Galang RR; González M; Ricaldi JN; Anderson KN; Kamal N; Thomas JD; Villanueva J; Burkel VK; Meaney-Delman D; Gilboa SM; Honein MA; Jamieson DJ; Ospina ML,"BACKGROUND: Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, which include brain and eye abnormalities. The clinical importance of detection of Zika virus RNA in amniotic fluid is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe patterns of Zika virus RNA testing of amniotic fluid relative to other clinical specimens and to examine the association between Zika virus detection in amniotic fluid and Zika-associated birth defects. Our null hypothesis was that Zika virus detection in amniotic fluid was not associated with Zika-associated birth defects. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of women with amniotic fluid specimens submitted to Colombia's National Institute of Health as part of national Zika virus surveillance from January 2016 to January 2017. Specimens (maternal serum, amniotic fluid, cord blood, umbilical cord tissue, and placental tissue) were tested for the presence of Zika virus RNA with the use of a singleplex or multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Birth defect information was abstracted from maternal prenatal and infant birth records and reviewed by expert clinicians. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare the frequency of Zika-associated birth defects (defined as brain abnormalities [with or without microcephaly, but excluding neural tube defects and their associated findings] or eye abnormalities) by frequency of detection of Zika virus RNA in amniotic fluid. RESULTS: Our analysis included 128 women with amniotic fluid specimens. Seventy-five women (58%) had prenatally collected amniotic fluid; 42 women (33%) had amniotic fluid collected at delivery, and 11 women (9%) had missing collection dates. Ninety-one women had both amniotic fluid and other clinical specimens submitted for testing, which allowed for comparison across specimen types. Of those 91 women, 68 had evidence of Zika virus infection based on detection of Zika virus RNA in ≥1 specimen. Testing of amniotic fluid that was collected prenatally or at delivery identified 39 of these Zika virus infections (57%; 15 [22%] infections were identified only in amniotic fluid), and 29 infections (43%) were identified in other specimen types and not amniotic fluid. Among women who were included in the analysis, 89 had pregnancy outcome information available, which allowed for the assessment of the presence of Zika-associated birth defects. Zika-associated birth defects were significantly (P<.05) more common among pregnancies with Zika virus RNA detected in amniotic fluid specimens collected prenatally (19/32 specimens; 59%) than for those with no laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection in any specimen (6/23 specimens; 26%), but the proportion was similar in pregnancies with only Zika virus RNA detected in specimens other than amniotic fluid (10/23 specimens; 43%). Although Zika-associated birth defects were more common among women with any Zika virus RNA detected in amniotic fluid specimens (ie, collected prenatally or at delivery; 21/43 specimens; 49%) than those with no laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection (6/23 specimens; 26%), this comparison did not reach statistical significance (P=.07). CONCLUSION: Testing of amniotic fluid provided additional evidence for maternal diagnosis of Zika virus infection. Zika-associated birth defects were more common among women with Zika virus RNA that was detected in prenatal amniotic fluid specimens than women with no laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection, but similar to women with Zika virus RNA detected in other, nonamniotic fluid specimen types.",2020,Jun,Am J Obstet Gynecol,222,6,610.e1-610.e13,,10.1016/j.ajog.2020.01.009,31954155,#11239,Mercado 2020,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Molecular surveillance of arboviruses in Nigeria.,Shaibu JO; Akinyemi KO; Uzor OH; Audu RA; Bola Oriowo Oyefolu A,"Arboviral infections are fast becoming a global public health concern as a result of its high fatality rate and sporadic spread. From the outbreak of Zika virus in the Americas, the endemicity of Yellow fever in West Africa and South America, outbreaks of West Nile virus in South Africa to the year-round and national risk of Dengue fever in Mainland China and India. The war against emerging and re-emerging viral infection could probably lead to the next pandemic. To be above the pending possible arboviral pandemic, consistent surveillance of these pathogens is necessary in every society. This study was aimed at conducting a surveillance for Yellow fever virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Rift Valley fever virus in four states in Nigeria using molecular techniques. A cross-sectional study involving 1600 blood samples collected from febrile patients in Lagos, Kwara, Ondo and Delta States between 2018 and 2021 was conducted using Real time polymerase chain reaction for detection of the pathogens. Extraction and purification of viral RNA were done using Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit. Samples were analyzed using One Step PrimeScript III RT-PCR mix (Takara Bio) alongside optimized primers and probes designed in-house. Positive samples were sequenced on MinION platform (Nanopore technologies). Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis were performed with DNASTAR Lasergene 17.3. All the RNA extracted from samples collected from the four states were negative for ZIKV RNA, RVFV RNA, CHIKV RNA and DENV RNA. However, twelve of the samples (2%) tested positive for YFV RNA. Three full genomes of sizes 10,751 bp, 10,500 bp and 10,715 bp were generated and deposited in GenBank with accession numbers: ON323052, ON323053 and ON323054 respectively.

Two-year Decay of Zika Virus Neutralizing Antibodies in People Living in an Endemic Region in Brazil.,Magalhaes T; Morais CNL; Azevedo EAN; Jacques IJAA; Castanha PMS; Cordeiro MT; Braga C; Jaenisch T; Marques ETA; Foy BD,"It is currently not clear whether humoral immunity to Zika virus (ZIKV) elicited upon natural ZIKV infection is long-lasting. In addition, cross-reactivity of anti-ZIKV antibodies with antigenically related dengue viruses (DENV) may have biological implications in nonnaive individuals who subsequently acquire a heterotypic infection. Cross-reactive humoral immunity between ZIKV and DENV also complicates the interpretation of serological tests to evaluate previous exposure to either virus. Here, we have measured the 2-year decay of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies in people living in a ZIKV/DENV endemic area in Brazil who were identified as having an acute infection (group 1) or past (but recent) infection (group 2) with ZIKV in 2015-16. The titers of neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV decreased 9.1 and 2.3 times in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

Decomposition of socioeconomic inequalities in arboviral diseases in Brazil and Colombia (2007-2017).,Carabali M; Harper S; Lima Neto AS; Dos Santos de Sousa G; Caprara A; Restrepo BN; Kaufman JS,"BACKGROUND: We used surveillance data from Brazil and Colombia during 2007-2017 to assess the presence of socioeconomic inequalities on dengue, chikungunya and Zika at the neighborhood level in two Latin American cities. METHODS: To quantify the inequality, we estimated and decomposed the relative concentration index of inequality (RCI) accounting for the spatiotemporal distribution of the diseases. RESULTS: There were 281 426 arboviral cases notified in Fortaleza, Brazil, and 40 889 in Medellin, Colombia. The RCI indicated greater concentration of dengue cases among people living in low socioeconomic settings in both sites. The RCIs for chikungunya in Fortaleza covered the line of equality during their introduction in 2014, while the RCIs for Zika and chikungunya in Medellin indicated the presence of a small inequality. The RCI decomposition showed that year of notification and age were the main contributors to this inequality. In Medellin, the RCI decomposition showed that age and access to waste management accounted for 75.5%, 72.2% and 54.5% of the overall inequality towards the poor for dengue, chikungunya and Zika, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents estimates of the socioeconomic inequality of arboviruses and its decomposition in two Latin American cities. We corroborate the concentration of arboviral diseases in low socioeconomic neighborhoods and identify that year of occurrence, age, presence of healthcare facilities and waste management are key determinants of the heterogenous distribution of endemic arboviruses across the socioeconomic spectrum.",2022,Aug,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,116,8,717-726,,10.1093/trstmh/trac004,35088864,#11392,Carabali 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Systematic review: fetal death reporting and risk in Zika-affected pregnancies.,Leisher SH; Balalian AA; Reinebrant H; Shiau S; Flenady V; Kuhn L; Morse SS,"OBJECTIVES: Zika virus is linked to several adverse pregnancy outcomes. We assessed whether Zika infection during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of foetal death (miscarriage, stillbirth, abortion) and whether there is incomplete reporting of such deaths. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and LILACS for studies reporting Zika-affected completed pregnancies (ending in foetal death or live birth), excluding studies whose aim required live birth. Studies 'allowed' foetal death if their populations were defined to encompass both live births and foetal deaths, regardless of whether deaths were actually found. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Foetal death absolute and relative risks in Zika-affected vs. unaffected pregnancies were calculated. RESULTS: We found 108 reports including 24 699 completed, Zika-affected pregnancies. The median absolute risk in 37 studies of completed, Zika-affected pregnancies was 6.3% (IQR 3.2%, 10.6%) for foetal death and 5.9% (IQR 0%, 29.1%) for non-fatal adverse outcomes (e.g. microcephaly). More studies allowed non-fatal adverse outcomes (95%) than foetal death (58%). Of studies which allowed them, 94% found at least one foetal death. In 37% of reports, it was unknown whether foetal deaths were allowed. Only one study had sufficient data to estimate a foetal death relative risk (11.05, 95% CI 3.43, 35.55).

"Analysis of the socio-environmental vulnerability of black and Caucasian pregnant women in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil to the occurrence of microcephaly associated with the congenital syndrome of zika virus.",Santana KSO; D'Oliveira Júnior A; De Jesus Bittencourt L; Nascimento MM; Santos Guimarães IC; Soares Ê; De Santana Martins Rodgers M; Fradkin AN,"To understand the occurrence of the Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), the living conditions of pregnant individuals must be considered in order to identify factors and areas of risk. An intersectional approach provides an understanding of the vulnerabilities to which Black women are subjected. To that end, we present an overview of the spatio-temporal distribution of confirmed cases of microcephaly associated with CZS during the 2015-2016 period in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil based on a survey of Black and Caucasian, pregnant women seen through the intersectional lens of race and class. To consider the confirmed cases of microcephaly and other neurological anomalies associated with CZS, a Living Condition Index (LCI) was utilized to rate the socio-environmental vulnerability of pregnant women. There was less information in the notification records with regard to Black, pregnant women resulting in fewer examinations. Twelve, highrisk areas for Black, pregnant women were identified but only two for Caucasian women. CZS cases referred to Black, pregnant women were found to be concentrated in census sectors with a low (31.6%) and very low (34.5%) LCI, while those referred to Caucasian, pregnant women were concentrated in areas with a high (35.6%) and intermediate (29.4%) LCI. The study concludes that inequities in health expose different population groups to different forms of illnesses, and institutional racism solidifies scenarios of exclusion.

To determine the ratio of microcephaly in newborns in level II and III health facilities of the Ministry of Health (MINSA) of Peru for the period 2005-2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A secondary analysis of the databases of the Perinatal Information System was carried out during 2005-2013. Microcephaly was identified applying World Health Organization (WHO), Fenton, mixed (WHO-Fenton), and proportionality criteria. The ratios and indices of microcephaly were estimated per 10,000 live births (LB) by region and concordance was compared, using the WHO parameter as a reference. RESULTS. The ratio of microcephaly during 2005 to 2013 was 3.4%, the average rate of microcephaly was 335 per 10,000 LBs according to the WHO criterion. The mixed parameter showed a substantial concordance (Kappa of 0.635), while the proportionality parameter showed a reasonable concordance (Kappa of 0.298). CONCLUSIONS. The ratio of microcephaly in MINSA Level II and III health facilities was higher than that reported in other countries in the region before the appearance of Zika in the Americas. The frequency variations observed with those of other countries and among Peruvian regions could be explained by different factors, such as the technique for measuring head circumference, data capture, constitutional factors, and social determinants.

Evidence of a reduction in dengue case incidence following field releases of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti has been reported previously from a cluster randomised controlled trial in Indonesia, and quasi-experimental studies in Indonesia and northern Australia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Following pilot releases in 2015-2016 and a period of intensive community engagement, deployments of adult wMel-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were conducted in Niterói, Brazil during 2017-2019. Deployments were phased across four release zones, with a total area of 83 km2 and a residential population of approximately 373,000. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of wMel deployments in reducing dengue, chikungunya and Zika incidence. An untreated control zone was pre-defined, which was comparable to the intervention area in historical dengue trends. The wMel intervention effect was estimated by controlled interrupted time series analysis of monthly dengue, chikungunya and Zika case notifications to the public health surveillance system before, during and after releases, from release zones and the control zone. Three years after commencement of releases, wMel introgression into local Ae. aegypti populations was heterogeneous throughout Niterói, reaching a high prevalence (>80%) in the earliest release zone, and more moderate levels (prevalence 40-70%) elsewhere. Despite this spatial heterogeneity in entomological outcomes, the wMel intervention was associated with a 69% reduction in dengue incidence (95% confidence interval 54%, 79%), a 56% reduction in chikungunya incidence (95%CI 16%, 77%) and a 37% reduction in Zika incidence (95%CI 1%, 60%), in the aggregate release area compared with the pre-defined control area. This significant intervention effect on dengue was replicated across all four release zones, and in three of four zones for chikungunya, though not in individual release zones for Zika. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that wMel Wolbachia can be successfully introgressed into Ae. aegypti populations in a large and complex urban setting, and that a significant public health benefit from reduced incidence of Aedes-borne disease accrues even where the prevalence of wMel in local mosquito populations is moderate and spatially heterogeneous. These findings are consistent with the results of randomised and non-randomised field trials in Indonesia and northern Australia, and are supportive of the Wolbachia biocontrol method as a multivalent intervention against dengue, chikungunya and Zika.",2021,Jul,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,15,7,e0009556,figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.13662203.v3figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.13662230.v2,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009556,34252106,#11570,Pinto 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Malnutrition affects the risk and response to infections, but the role of diet on flaviviral infection risk is uncertain. The objective of this study was to investigate the relations between dietary patterns adherence and anti-flavivirus IgG seroconversion in children during a Zika epidemic in a dengue-endemic area of Colombia. In 2015-2016, we followed 424 anti-flavivirus IgG seronegative children aged 2 to 12 years for 1 year. Baseline data included children's sociodemographic, anthropometric, and dietary information collected through a 38-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). IgG testing was repeated at the end of follow-up. The primary exposure was adherence to each of four dietary patterns (animal foods, traditional, ultraprocessed foods, and prudent) that were identified from the FFQ through principal component analysis. Secondary exposures were intake frequencies of foods contributing to relevant patterns. We estimated risk of seroconversion by quartiles of adherence scores and compared them using relative risks (RR) and 95% CI from Poisson regression adjusted for sex, age, and socioeconomic status indicators. Seroconversion risk was 32.1%. Adherence to the traditional pattern was positively related to seroconversion. RR comparing fourth versus first quartiles of adherence was 1.52 (95% CI: 1.04-2.21; P trend = 0.02). Of the most representative foods in this pattern, potato and sugarcane water intake frequencies were related to increased seroconversion risk.

The co-circulation of these emergent arboviruses constitutes a serious public health problem, resulting in outbreaks that can spatially and temporally overlap. Environmental conditions favor the presence, maintenance, and expansion of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of these urban arboviruses. This study assessed the detection of clusters of urban arboviruses in the Rio de Janeiro state from 2010 to 2019. Notified cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika were grouped by year according to the onset of symptoms and their municipality of residence. The study period recorded the highest number of dengue epidemics in the state along with the simultaneous circulation of chikungunya and Zika viruses. The analyzes showed that the central municipalities of the metropolitan regions were associated with higher risk areas. Central municipalities in metropolitan regions were the first most likely clusters for dengue and Zika, and the second most likely cluster for chikungunya.

Association Between Arthrogryposis and Mortality in Infants With Congenital Zika Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Martins-Filho PR; Souza Tavares CS; Araújo Carvalho AC; Reis MCDS; Santos HP Jr; Santos VS,"BACKGROUND: Intrauterine Zika virus infection is associated with neurological disorders and other problems, including such as impaired visual and hearing function and orthopedic abnormalities, including arthrogryposis. We systematically investigated the prevalence of arthrogryposis in infants with congenital Zika syndrome and the respective risk of mortality. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports published in PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and World Health Organization Global Index Medicus databases, using the keywords Zika virus and arthrogryposis and related terms. RESULTS: After screening titles and abstracts, a total of four studies were included. Arthrogryposis was not associated with increased risk for fetal demise (risk ratio, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 15.26). However, arthrogryposis was associated with a 13-fold increased risk of mortality in neonates with congenital Zika syndrome (risk ratio, 13.11; 95% confidence interval, 3.74 to 45.92) than neonates with congenital Zika syndrome but without arthrogryposis. CONCLUSIONS: Neonates with both congenital Zika syndrome and arthrogryposis had higher morbidity and mortality risks, making it necessary to implement protocols for the early identification of neuromuscular changes and appropriate management of patients.",2020,Sep,Pediatr Neurol,110,,20-24,,10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2020.05.007,32646676,#11736,Martins-Filho 2020,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

METHODS: A dual prospective and retrospective cohort study involving 102 pairs of mothers and fetuses/children with CZS whose infection was confirmed by testing for the Zika virus in amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, and fragments from the placenta of the newborn infant (confirmed CZS), or by intrauterine imaging tests (neurosonography), and/or postnatal computed tomography (presumed CZS). RESULTS: Suspicion of CZS was investigated by ultrasonography during pregnancy in 52.9% of cases. The principal prenatal imaging findings were ventriculomegaly (43.1%) and microcephaly (42.2%). Median gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks, with 15.7% being premature. Mean head circumference at birth was 30.0 ± 2.3 cm, with 66% of cases being classified as having microcephaly. Arthrogryposis was found in 10 cases (9.8%). There were no fetal deaths; however, nine neonatal deaths were recorded, and three autopsies were performed. CONCLUSION: Neonatal mortality was high, almost 10%.

Fetal growth assessed via ultrasound in relation to maternal HIV infection status and antiretroviral regimens.,Williams PL; Karalius B; Patel K; Aschengrau A; Chakhtoura N; Enriquez N; Moye J; Garvie PA; Monte D; Seage GR 3rd; Zorrilla C; Mussi-Pinhata MM,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effects of maternal HIV and antiretroviral treatment (ART) on intrauterine fetal growth. DESIGN: Prospective cohort studies of HIV and ZIKA infection among women living with HIV (WLHIV) and women not living with HIV (WNLHIV) conducted in Brazil and the US from 2016 to 2020. METHODS: We evaluated fetal growth via repeated ultrasounds and calculated z scores for fetal growth measures using Intergrowth-21st standards among women with singleton pregnancies. Adjusted linear mixed models were fit for each fetal growth z score by HIV status. Among WLHIV, we compared fetal growth z scores by the most common maternal ART regimens, stratified by timing of ART initiation. RESULTS: We included 166 WLHIV and 705 WNLHIV; none had Zika infection. The z scores were similar for WLHIV and WNLHIV for femur length (latest third trimester median = 1.08) and estimated fetal weight (median ≈0.60); adjusted mean differences in fetal weight z scores by HIV status were less than 0.1 throughout gestation. Other fetal growth measurements were lower for WLHIV than WNLHIV early in gestation but increased more rapidly over gestation. Among WLHIV not on ART at conception, adjusted mean z scores were generally similar across regimens initiated during pregnancy but somewhat lower for atazanavir-based regimens for biparietal diameter compared with efavirenz-based or raltegravir-based regimens. Among WLHIV on ART at conception, mean z scores were similar across ART regimens.

Clinical aspects of congenital microcephaly syndrome by Zika virus in a rehabilitation center for patients with microcephaly.,Almeida KJ; Martins ACB; Almendra ICCGE; Meneses GMS; Sampaio TDO; Campêlo JDCM; Bor-Seng-Shu E,"OBJECTIVE: In this study, we intend to identify the prevalence of clinical variables in children with microcephaly. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional and observational study with data collected from medical records of patients admitted to the microcephaly outpatient clinic of a referral center in Teresina-PI. Demographic (gender and age) and clinical data (presence of epilepsy, dysphagia, irritability, and associated comorbidities) were collected. The frequency of Zika virus as a probable etiology was determined from computed tomography patterns and the exclusion of other etiologies by serological tests. RESULTS: A total of 67 patient records were evaluated, of which 31 were male and 36 were female, with a mean age of 1 year and 10 months. The most prevalent clinical variables were epilepsy, present in 47 children (70.2%), and irritability in 37 (55.2%). Also with a high frequency, 22 had dysphagia (32.8%), and 13 had musculoskeletal comorbidities (19.4%). Only three patients in the sample had cardiac abnormalities (4.5%), and no endocrine comorbidity was found. A total of 38 children in the sample (56.7%) presented ZIKV as a probable etiology and, in these cases, there was a higher frequency of epilepsy and dysphagia compared to other etiologies, although not statistically significant.

"Arbovirus, herpesvirus, and enterovirus associated with neurological syndromes in adult patients of a university hospital, 2017-2018.",Leon LL; Lima RG; Boffi LC; Bindilatti RN; Garlipp CR; Costa SCB; Bonon SHA,"INTRODUCTION: Herpesviruses, enteroviruses, and arboviruses are important because of their clinical relevance and ability to cause meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and other diseases. The clinical virology associated with diagnostic technologies can reduce the morbidity and mortality of such neurological manifestations. Here we aimed to identify the genomes of agents that cause neurological syndromes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected nervous system infections admitted to the University Hospital of the University of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil, in 2017-2018. METHODS: CSF samples collected from adult patients with neurological syndrome symptoms and negative CSF culture results were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase-PCR, and real-time PCR, and their results were compared with their clinical symptoms. One CSF sample was obtained from each patient. RESULTS: Viral genomes were detected in 148/420 (35.2%) CSF samples: one of 148 (0.2%) was positive for herpes simplex virus-1; two (0.5%) for herpes simplex virus-2; eight (1.9%) for varicella-zoster virus; four (1%) for Epstein-Barr virus; one (0.2%) for cytomegalovirus; 32 (7.6%) for human herpesvirus-6; 30 (7.1%) for non-polio enterovirus; 67 (16.0%) for dengue virus, three (0.7%) for yellow fever virus, and 21 (5%) for Zika virus.

In areas of the United States that experienced local Zika virus transmission, the prevalence of birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection during pregnancy increased in the second half of 2016 compared with the first half (4). To update the previous report, CDC analyzed population-based surveillance data from 22 states and territories to estimate the prevalence of birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection, regardless of laboratory evidence of or exposure to Zika virus, among pregnancies completed during January 1, 2016-June 30, 2017. Jurisdictions were categorized as those 1) with widespread local transmission of Zika virus; 2) with limited local transmission of Zika virus; and 3) without local transmission of Zika virus. Among 2,004,630 live births, 3,359 infants and fetuses with birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection during pregnancy were identified (1.7 per 1,000 live births, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-1.7). In areas with widespread local Zika virus transmission, the prevalence of birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection during pregnancy was significantly higher during the quarters comprising July 2016-March 2017 (July-September 2016 = 3.0; October-December 2016 = 4.0; and January-March 2017 = 5.6 per 1,000 live births) compared with the reference period (January-March 2016) (1.3 per 1,000). These findings suggest a fourfold increase (prevalence ratio [PR] = 4.1, 95% CI = 2.1-8.4) in birth defects potentially related to Zika virus in widespread local transmission areas during January-March 2017 compared with that during January-March 2016, with the highest prevalence (7.0 per 1,000 live births) in February 2017.

Geostatistical models combine data from multiple locations and use links with environmental and socioeconomic factors to make predictive risk maps. Here we systematically review past approaches to map risk for different Aedes-borne arboviruses from local to global scales, identifying differences and similarities in the data types, covariates, and modelling approaches used. METHODS: We searched on-line databases for predictive risk mapping studies for dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever with no geographical or date restrictions. We included studies that needed to parameterise or fit their model to real-world epidemiological data and make predictions to new spatial locations of some measure of population-level risk of viral transmission (e.g. incidence, occurrence, suitability, etc.). RESULTS: We found a growing number of arbovirus risk mapping studies across all endemic regions and arboviral diseases, with a total of 176 papers published 2002-2022 with the largest increases shortly following major epidemics. Three dominant use cases emerged: (i) global maps to identify limits of transmission, estimate burden and assess impacts of future global change, (ii) regional models used to predict the spread of major epidemics between countries and (iii) national and sub-national models that use local datasets to better understand transmission dynamics to improve outbreak detection and response. Temperature and rainfall were the most popular choice of covariates (included in 50% and 40% of studies respectively) but variables such as human mobility are increasingly being included. Surprisingly, few studies (22%, 31/144) robustly tested combinations of covariates from different domains (e.g. climatic, sociodemographic, ecological, etc.) and only 49% of studies assessed predictive performance via out-of-sample validation procedures.

Although Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) accounts for around 15% of reported cases, the aetiology of most cases remains unknown. We aimed to establish an enhanced surveillance network and to use a standardised diagnostic algorithm to conduct a systematic evaluation of acute encephalitis syndrome in India. METHODS: In this large-scale, systematic surveillance study in India, patients presenting with acute encephalitis syndrome (ie, acute onset of fever with altered mental status, seizure, or both) to any of the 18 participating hospitals across Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Assam were evaluated for JEV (serum and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] IgM ELISA) per standard of care. In enhanced surveillance, JEV IgM-negative specimens were additionally evaluated for scrub typhus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus by serum IgM ELISA, and for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, dengue virus, herpes simplex virus, and enterovirus by CSF PCR across five referral laboratories. In 2017, chikungunya and Leptospira serum IgM by ELISA and Zika virus serum and CSF by PCR were also tested. FINDINGS: Of 10 107 patients with acute encephalitis syndrome enrolled in enhanced surveillance between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2017, 5734 (57·8%) of 9917 participants with available data were male and 6179 (62·7%) of 9856 were children aged 15 years and younger. Among patients who provided a sample of either CSF or serum in enhanced surveillance, an aetiology was identified in 1921 (33·2%) of 5786 patients enrolled between 2014 and 2016 and in 1484 (34·3%) of 4321 patients enrolled in 2017. The most commonly identified aetiologies were JEV (1023 [17·7%] of 5786 patients), scrub typhus (645 [18·5%] of 3489), and dengue virus (161 [5·2%] of 3124). Among participants who provided both CSF and serum specimens, an aetiology was identified in 1446 (38·3%) of 3774 patients enrolled between 2014 and 2016 and in 936 (40·3%) of 2324 enrolled in 2017, representing a 3·1-times increase in the number of patients with acute encephalitis syndrome with an identified aetiology compared with standard care alone (299 [12·9%]; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Implementation of a systematic diagnostic algorithm in an enhanced surveillance platform resulted in a 3·1-times increase in identification of the aetiology of acute encephalitis syndrome, besides JEV alone, and highlighted the importance of scrub typhus and dengue virus as important infectious aetiologies in India.

Brazil's Missing Infants: Zika Risk Changes Reproductive Behavior.,Rangel MA; Nobles J; Hamoudi A,"Zika virus epidemics have potential large-scale population effects. Controlled studies of mice and nonhuman primates indicate that Zika affects fecundity, raising concerns about miscarriage in human populations. In regions of Brazil, Zika risk peaked months before residents learned about the epidemic and its relation to congenital anomalies. This spatiotemporal variation supports analysis of both biological effects of Zika infection on fertility and the effects of learning about Zika risk on reproductive behavior. Causal inference techniques used with vital statistics indicate that the epidemic caused reductions in birth cohort size of approximately one-quarter 18 months after Zika infection risk peaked but 10 months after public health messages advocated childbearing delay. The evidence is consistent with small but not statistically detectable biological reductions in fecundity, as well as large strategic changes in reproductive behavior to temporally align childbearing with reduced risk to infant health. The behavioral effects are larger for more-educated and older women, which may reflect facilitated access to information and to family planning services within high-risk, mosquito-infested urban locations as well as perceptions about the opportunity costs of risks to pregnancy and infant survival.",2020,Oct,Demography,57,5,1647-1680,,10.1007/s13524-020-00900-9,32875482,#12125,Rangel 2020,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,
The global scientific research response to the public health emergency of Zika virus infection.,Oliveira JF; Pescarini JM; Rodrigues MS; Almeida BA; Henriques CMP; Gouveia FC; Rabello ET; Matta GC; Barreto ML; Sampaio RB,"BACKGROUND: Science studies have been a field of research for different knowledge areas, and they have been successfully used to analyse the construction of scientific knowledge, practice and dissemination. In this study, we aimed to verify how the Zika epidemic has moulded the scientific articles published worldwide by analysing international collaborations and the knowledge landscape through time, as well as research topics and country involvement. METHODOLOGY: We searched the Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and PubMed for studies published up to 31st December 2018 on Zika using the search terms ""zika"", ""zkv"" or ""zikv"". We analysed the scientific production regarding which countries have published the most, on which topics, as well as country level collaboration. We performed a scientometric analysis of research on Zika focusing on knowledge mapping and the scientific research path over time and space. FINDINGS: We found two well defined research areas divided into three subtopics accounting for six clusters. With regard to country analysis, the USA and Brazil were the countries with the highest numbers of publications on Zika. China entered as a new player focusing on specific research areas. When we took into consideration the epidemics and reported cases, Brazil and France were the leading research countries on related topics. As for international collaboration, the USA followed by England and France stand out as the main hubs. The research areas most published included public health-related topics from 2015 until the very beginning of 2016, followed by an increase in topics related to the clinical aspects of the disease in 2016 and the emergence of laboratory research in 2017/2018.

Causes of fever in returning travelers: a European multicenter prospective cohort study.,Camprubí-Ferrer D; Cobuccio L; Van Den Broucke S; Genton B; Bottieau E; d'Acremont V; Rodriguez-Valero N; Almuedo-Riera A; Balerdi-Sarasola L; Subirà C; Fernandez-Pardos M; Martinez MJ; Navero-Castillejos J; Vera I; Llenas-Garcia J; Rothe C; Cadar D; Van Esbroeck M; Foque N; Muñoz J,"BACKGROUND: Etiological diagnosis of febrile illnesses in returning travelers is a great challenge, particularly when presenting with no focal symptoms [acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses (AUFI)], but is crucial to guide clinical decisions and public health policies. In this study, we describe the frequencies and predictors of the main causes of fever in travelers. METHODS: Prospective European multicenter cohort study of febrile international travelers (November 2017-November 2019). A predefined diagnostic algorithm was used ensuring a systematic evaluation of all participants. After ruling out malaria, PCRs and serologies for dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses were performed in all patients presenting with AUFI ≤ 14 days after return. Clinical suspicion guided further microbiological investigations. RESULTS: Among 765 enrolled participants, 310/765 (40.5%) had a clear source of infection (mainly traveler's diarrhea or respiratory infections), and 455/765 (59.5%) were categorized as AUFI. AUFI presented longer duration of fever (p < 0.001), higher hospitalization (p < 0.001) and ICU admission rates (p < 0.001). Among travelers with AUFI, 132/455 (29.0%) had viral infections, including 108 arboviruses, 96/455 (21.1%) malaria and 82/455 (18.0%) bacterial infections. The majority of arboviral cases (80/108, 74.1%) was diagnosed between May and November. Dengue was the most frequent arbovirosis (92/108, 85.2%). After 1 month of follow-up, 136/455 (29.9%) patients with AUFI remained undiagnosed using standard diagnostic methods. No relevant differences in laboratory presentation were observed between undiagnosed and bacterial AUFI. CONCLUSIONS: Over 40% of returning travelers with AUFI were diagnosed with malaria or dengue, infections that can be easily diagnosed by rapid diagnostic tests. Arboviruses were the most common cause of AUFI (above malaria) and most cases were diagnosed during Aedes spp. high season. This is particularly relevant for those areas at risk of introduction of these pathogens. Empirical antibiotic regimens including doxycycline or azithromycin should be considered in patients with AUFI, after ruling out malaria and arboviruses.",2022,Mar,J Travel Med,29,2,,,10.1093/jtm/taac002,35040473,#12170,Camprubí-Ferrer 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

"Prevalence of Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika Viruses in Febrile Pregnant Women: An Observational Study at a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India.",Gupta A; Jain P; Venkatesh V; Agarwal A; Reddy DH; Jain A,"Dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) are arboviruses that can affect maternal and fetal outcome if acquired during pregnancy. This study was done to estimate the positivity of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in febrile pregnant women attending a tertiary care hospital in north India. Symptomatic pregnant women were tested for these viruses by IgM ELISA and/or by Trioplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Their symptoms and laboratory parameters were recorded and were followed up till delivery to know their immediate delivery outcome. Of 104 women tested, 50 (48.1%) were positive for viral markers. Of these, evidence of infection by DENV, CHIKV, and both was found in 34 (32.7%), 10 (9.6%), and 6 (5.8%), respectively. ZIKV was not detected in any woman. Maximum DENV positivity occurred in the third trimester of pregnancy and in women residing in urban than rural areas. Chills and rigors, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, anemia, and vaginal bleeding were more commonly associated with DENV positivity. Backache, arthralgia, jaundice, and vaginal bleeding were more common in CHIKV positives but the difference between positives and nonpositives regarding these symptoms was not statistically significant. Dengue infections were associated with more frequent hospitalizations (OR = 8.38, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 3.29-21.30) and mortality (OR = 19.0, 95% CI = 1.01-357.10).

Health outcomes associated with Zika virus infection in humans: a systematic review of systematic reviews.,Ximenes R; Ramsay LC; Miranda RN; Morris SK; Murphy K; Sander B,"OBJECTIVE: With the emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) disease in Central and South America in the mid-2010s and recognition of the teratogenic effects of congenital exposure to ZIKV, there has been a substantial increase in new research published on ZIKV. Our objective is to synthesise the literature on health outcomes associated with ZIKV infection in humans. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review (SR) of SRs following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and LILACS (Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde) databases from inception to 22 July 2019, and included SRs that reported ZIKV-associated health outcomes. Three independent reviewers selected eligible studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of included SRs using the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) tool. Conflicts were resolved by consensus or consultation with a third reviewer. RESULTS: The search yielded 1382 unique articles, of which 21 SRs met our inclusion criteria. The 21 SRs ranged from descriptive to quantitative data synthesis, including four meta-analyses. The most commonly reported ZIKV-associated manifestations and health outcomes were microcephaly, congenital abnormalities, brain abnormalities, neonatal death and Guillain-Barré syndrome. The included reviews were highly heterogeneous. The overall quality of the SRs was critically low with all studies having more than one critical weakness. CONCLUSION: The evolving nature of the literature on ZIKV-associated health outcomes, together with the critically low quality of existing SRs, demonstrates the need for high-quality SRs to guide patient care and inform policy decision making.

Incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome at a secondary centre during the 2016 zika outbreak.,Del Carpio Orantes L; Juárez Rangel FJ; García-Méndez S,"INTRODUCTION: Although Guillain-Barré syndrome is rare, a marked increase in incidence was observed during the 2016 Zika outbreak in the Americas, with no direct causal relationship being apparent in all cases. METHODS: Cases of febrile exanthematous disease and acute flaccid paralysis were reviewed during the period from 1 August to 15 December, 2016; clinical and biochemical assessment was performed for each case to identify Zika-related Guillain-Barré syndrome. RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 8 patients (6 men and 2 women) with Zika-related Guillain-Barré syndrome, with the most affected age group being 50-59 years. The highest incidence was in the month of September, with 7 cases. The most frequent symptoms were rash and conjunctivitis, followed by fever. The most common presentation was symmetrical ascending paralysis, present in 7 cases. Cranial nerve VII was the most frequently involved nerve. Only 2 patients presented albuminocytologic dissociation. RT-PCR returned negative results for Zika virus in all patients. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and all had a good prognosis. None warranted mechanical ventilation. No deaths were recorded. The cumulative incidence rate was 3.9%, monthly incidence was between 0.04 and 2 cases/month. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome increased during the Zika outbreak, with an increase in incidence and number of cases per month; however, a direct causal relationship between the 2 conditions could not be demonstrated.",2020,Apr,Neurologia (Engl Ed),35,3,160-164,,10.1016/j.nrl.2017.07.019,28958396,#12264,DelCarpioOrantes 2020,Exclusion reason: not in English; Extractor (2024-08-13 04:17:21)(Select): spanish; Extractor (2024-04-17 18:20:50)(Screen): risk factors?; ,
"Temporal trends in diagnoses of congenital microcephaly, Texas Hospital Discharge Diagnoses, 2000-2015.",Waller DK; Tark JY; Agopian AJ; Shewale J; Ganduglia-Cazaban C; Hoyt AT; Scheuerle AE; Langlois PH,"OBJECTIVE: Assess temporal trends in congenital microcephaly. METHODS: We used Texas inpatient discharge diagnoses between 2000 and 2015, restricting to newborns. Between 2000 and 2003, the maximum number of fields for recording diagnostic codes was eight, and between 2004 and 2015 it was 24. Microcephaly was classified into four subgroups based on co-occurring diagnoses: A (Known Causes), B (Other Birth Defects), C (Preterm Birth or Fetal Growth Restriction) and D (Isolated Cases). RESULTS: We identified 2,301 cases of microcephaly or 4.0 cases per 10,000 live births. There was an increase in the prevalence of microcephaly in 2012-2015 compared with 2000-2003, odds ratio = 1.85 (95% CI 1.64-2.10) Significant temporal increases in microcephaly were observed within each of the four microcephaly subgroups and significant temporal increases were also observed for eight other neonatal diagnoses during the same time period. When we restricted our analysis to cases with microcephaly identified using only the eight diagnostic codes available throughout the entire study period, the temporal trend for microcephaly was diminished or absent. CONCLUSIONS: It remains uncertain whether the observed increases in microcephaly and other neonatal diagnoses are real or an artifact of the change in the number of fields. However, since it is unlikely that there would be a simultaneous increase in microcephaly and eight other neonatal diagnoses, it is likely that some or all of the temporal increases in neonatal diagnoses are artifactual.",2019,Jun,Birth Defects Res,111,10,584-590,,10.1002/bdr2.1491,30864280,#12266,Waller 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
"Estimation of the Size of Dengue and Zika Infection Among Korean Travelers to Southeast Asia and Latin America, 2016-2017.",Chu C; Shin ES,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the number and risk of imported infections resulting from people visiting Asian and Latin American countries. METHODS: The dataset of visitors to 5 Asian countries with dengue were analyzed for 2016 and 2017, and in the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, imported cases of zika virus infection were also reported. For zika virus, a single imported case was reported from Brazil in 2016, and 2 imported cases reported from the Maldives in 2017. To understand the transmissibility in 5 Southeast Asian countries, the estimate of the force of infection, i.e., the hazard of infection per year and the average duration of travel has been extracted. Outbound travel numbers were retrieved from the World Tourism Organization, including business travelers. RESULTS: The incidence of imported dengue in 2016 was estimated at 7.46, 15.00, 2.14, 4.73 and 2.40 per 100,000 travelers visiting Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, respectively. Similarly, 2.55, 1.65, 1.53, 1.86 and 1.70 per 100,000 travelers in 2017, respectively. It was estimated that there were 60.1 infections (range: from 16.8 to 150.7 infections) with zika virus in Brazil, 2016, and 345.6 infections (range: from 85.4 to 425.5 infections) with zika virus in the Maldives, 2017.

A to Z of Zika Virus: A Comprehensive Review for Clinicians.,Arora HS,"Since its first outbreak in 2007 in the Pacific (Yap islands and Federal States of Micronesia), Zika virus has gradually and recently spread to the Americas in 2015. The neurotropic character of the virus was first noted during this outbreak in Brazil in 2015. Increasing number of infants born with microcephaly and other congenital deformities were identified through studies that have highlighted the importance of prevention of transmission of Zika virus in pregnant women. Long-term outcomes in infants born with this infection are now better understood than at the time of onset of this outbreak.

"An optimal control model for COVID-19, zika, dengue, and chikungunya co-dynamics with reinfection.",Omame A; Isah ME; Abbas M,"The co-circulation of different emerging viral diseases is a big challenge from an epidemiological point of view. The similarity of symptoms, cases of virus co-infection, and cross-reaction can mislead in the diagnosis of the disease. In this article, a new mathematical model for COVID-19, zika, chikungunya, and dengue co-dynamics is developed and studied to assess the impact of COVID-19 on zika, dengue, and chikungunya dynamics and vice-versa. The local and global stability analyses are carried out. The model is shown to undergo a backward bifurcation under a certain condition. Global sensitivity analysis is also performed on the parameters of the model to determine the most dominant parameters. If the zika-related reproduction number ℛ0Z is used as the response function, then important parameters are: the effective contact rate for vector-to-human transmission of zika ( β2h , which is positively correlated), the human natural death rate ( ϑh , positively correlated), and the vector recruitment rate ( Ψv , also positively correlated). In addition, using the class of individuals co-infected with COVID-19 and zika ( ℐCZh ) as response function, the most dominant parameters are: the effective contact rate for COVID-19 transmission ( β1 , positively correlated), the effective contact rate for vector-to-human transmission of zika ( β2h , positively correlated). To control the co-circulation of all the diseases adequately under an endemic setting, time dependent controls in the form of COVID-19, zika, dengue, and chikungunya preventions are incorporated into the model and analyzed using the Pontryagin's principle. The model is fitted to real COVID-19, zika, dengue, and chikungunya datasets for Espirito Santo (a city with the co-circulation of all the diseases), in Brazil and projections made for the cumulative cases of each of the diseases. Through simulations, it is shown that COVID-19 prevention could greatly reduce the burden of co-infections with zika, dengue, and chikungunya. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the control of the arbovirus diseases is also highlighted. Furthermore, it is observed that prevention controls for zika, dengue, and chikungunya can significantly reduce the burden of co-infections with COVID-19.",2022,Sep,Optim Control Appl Methods,,,,,10.1002/oca.2936,36248678,#12446,Omame 2022,Exclusion reason: Co-infection study; ,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational study on patients with GBS, by using data from the epidemiological surveillance system. Biological samples, previously analyzed at the INS, were obtained to study arboviruses, respiratory viruses, enteroviruses and enterobacteria, among others. RESULTS: A total of 2,051 specimens were obtained from 906 patients with GBS. Three patients tested positive for dengue and three for Zika. In 19 patients, the stool culture was positive for Campylobacter jejuni. Phylogenetic analysis of 10 Campylobacter jejuni strains classified them as genotype ST2993, which was previously reported in China and associated to a GBS outbreak. Twelve cerebrospinal fluid samples tested positive for enterovirus by PCR in 2018, but none could be verified by culture or complete genome sequencing during the study. One patient was positive for influenza A, two for influenza B, two for adenovirus, five for respiratory syncytial virus, and ten for rinovirus. CONCLUSION: Several pathogens were found in samples from patients with GBS. However, we found that the genotype ST2993 of Campylobacter jejuni was the most likely causal agent, a pathogen that is related to GBS outbreaks in different continents.

We reviewed a total of 182 studies on dengue viruses (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFVV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and presence of Aedes mosquito vectors. In general, associations between socioeconomic conditions and both Aedes-borne diseases and Aedes mosquitoes are highly variable and often location-specific. Although 50% to 60% of studies found greater presence or prevalence of disease or vectors in areas with lower socioeconomic status, approximately half of the remaining studies found either positive or null associations.

History of arthropod-borne virus infections in French Polynesia.,Aubry M; Cao-Lormeau VM,"In French Polynesia, arthropod-borne diseases are major public health problems. From the mid-1940s, the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to -4) have caused 15 epidemics of variable severity. In 2013, for the first time, a sustained co-circulation of two different DENV serotypes (DENV-1 and -3) was reported. The same year, Zika virus (ZIKV) caused the largest outbreak ever recorded at that time. Severe neurologic complications in adults, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and central nervous system malformations in newborns and foeteuses, such as microcephaly, were reported, and a causal link with ZIKV infection was established. In addition to mosquito-borne transmission, the potential for perinatal, sexual and blood-transfusion transmission of ZIKV was demonstrated. In 2014, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused an explosive outbreak. Series of Guillain-Barré syndrome temporally associated with the CHIKV epidemic were reported. Except for DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV, no other arboviruses have been detected so far, but serologic evidence suggested the past silent circulation of Ross River virus. From May 2015 DENV-1 has been the only arbovirus transmitted in French Polynesia, but the reemergence of DENV-2 is highly expected since the detection of two autochthonous cases of DENV-2 infection in June 2018.",2019,May,New Microbes New Infect,29,,100513,,10.1016/j.nmni.2019.01.009,30899520,#12589,Aubry 2019,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-05-01 23:02:05)(Select): review; ,Review
"Co-circulation of Chikungunya virus, Zika virus, and serotype 1 of Dengue virus in Western Bahia, Brazil.",de França Cirilo MV; Pour SZ; de Fatima Benedetti V; Farias JP; Fogaça MMC; da Conceição Simões R; Vidal PO; Birbrair A; de Andrade Zanotto PM; Luiz WB; Amorim JH,"Chikungunya, mayaro, dengue, zika, and yellow fever are mosquito-borne viral diseases caused, respectively, by Chikungunya virus, Mayaro virus (CHIKV and MAYV, respectively: Togaviridae: Alphavirus), Dengue virus, Zika virus, and Yellow fever virus (DENV, ZIKV, and YFV, respectively: Flaviviridae: Flavivirus). These viruses have an important epidemiological impact worldwide, especially in Brazil. Western Bahia is one of the less studied regions in that country regarding the circulation of these pathogens. In this study, we aimed to apply molecular biology assays to better know the mosquito-borne viruses circulating in Barreiras and Luís Eduardo Magalhães, two main cities of Western Bahia. From March to June 2021, we enrolled 98 patients with the clinical diagnosis of dengue. Personal information (gender and age) were retrieved at the moment of enrollment. Serum samples were obtained from volunteers and used in molecular detection of CHIKV, MAYV, DENV, ZIKV, and YFV by reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction as well as in genome sequencing aiming phylogenetic analysis. As the main result, we found that from the 98 patients 45 were infected by CHIKV, 32 were infected by serotype 1 of DENV (DENV-1) and six were infected by ZIKV, while 15 were negative for all arboviruses tested. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed that all CHIKV-positive samples were of the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype, while all DENV-1-positive samples were of the V genotype. These results clearly show that epidemiological surveillance cannot be based only on clinical evaluations. Laboratory diagnosis is important in arbovirus infection that are prevalent in a particular area.

Children with CZS have a very poor prognosis with extremely low performance in motor, cognitive, and language development domains, and practically all feature severe forms of cerebral palsy. However, these manifestations are the tip of the iceberg, with some children presenting milder forms of deficits. Additionally, neurodevelopment can be in the normal range in the majority of the non-microcephalic children born without brain or eye abnormalities. Vertical transmission and the resulting disruption in development of the brain are much less frequent when maternal infection occurs in the second half of the pregnancy. Experimental studies have alerted to the possibility of other behavioral outcomes both in prenatally infected children and in postnatal and adult infections.

Global Prevalence of Zika and Chikungunya Coinfection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Ahmed S; Sultana S; Kundu S; Alam SS; Hossan T; Islam MA,"Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are arthropod-borne viruses with significant pathogenicity, posing a substantial health and economic burden on a global scale. Moreover, ZIKV-CHIKV coinfection imposes additional therapeutic challenges as there is no specific treatment for ZIKV or CHIKV infection. While a growing number of studies have documented the ZIKV-CHIKV coinfection, there is currently a lack of conclusive reports on this coinfection. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the true statistics of ZIKV-CHIKV coinfection in the global human population. Relevant studies were searched for in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar without limitation in terms of language or publication date. A total of 33 studies containing 41,460 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO under the registration number CRD42020176409. The pooled prevalence and confidence intervals of ZIKV-CHIKV coinfection were computed using a random-effects model. The study estimated a combined global prevalence rate of 1.0% [95% CI: 0.7-1.2] for the occurrence of ZIKV-CHIKV coinfection. The region of North America (Mexico, Haiti, and Nicaragua) and the country of Haiti demonstrated maximum prevalence rates of 2.8% [95% CI: 1.5-4.1] and 3.5% [95% CI: 0.2-6.8], respectively. Moreover, the prevalence of coinfection was found to be higher in the paediatric group (2.1% [95% CI: 0.0-4.2]) in comparison with the adult group (0.7% [95% CI: 0.2-1.1]).

Risk factors for neurological complications in children with Flavivirus infection.,Bentes AA; de Castro Romanelli RM; Marinho PES; Crispim APC; Loutfi KS; Viegas ECC; Kroon EG,"This study aims to characterize the acute neurological manifestations caused by DENV, ZIKV, and YFV during hospitalization; identify the risk factors associated with persistent neurological complications after discharge; and evaluate the time to resolution during clinical follow-up. A prospective study evaluated 505 children, between March 2014 and July 2019, hospitalized with neurological manifestations and that doctors suspected infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Viral infection of collected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Patients were clinically followed up after hospital discharge. Analysis of predictive factors and survival curves was performed. This study identified clinical symptoms and changes in the CSF laboratory, electroencephalogram (EEG), and CNS image as predictors of complications in children with confirmed infection in the CNS by DENV, ZIKV, or YFV. No statistical difference was found (p value 0.574) in the time to the resolution of complications in children after hospital discharge between the three types of flaviviruses. Children with YFV, detected in CSF samples, had a 53% higher risk of developing neurological complications.

METHODS: Thirty-one patients with anterior uveitis with intraocular pressure (IOP) above 25 mmHg were included for PCR analysis for cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex (HSV), varicella-zoster (VZV), rubella, chikungunya and Zika virus. RESULTS: The prevalence of PCR-positive results was 32%, including 19% for CMV, 10% for HSV, and 3% for VZV; PCR for other tested viruses demonstrated negative results. PCR-positive patients exhibited satisfactory IOP control with antiviral and anti-glaucomatous treatment compared to PCR-negative patients, and more than half of PCR-negative patients required glaucoma surgery within 12 months (P = .01).

Case report: Zika surveillance complemented with wastewater and mosquito testing.,Wong JCC; Tay M; Hapuarachchi HC; Lee B; Yeo G; Maliki D; Lee W; Mohamed Suhaimi NA; Chio K; Tan WCH; Ng LC,"BACKGROUND: In June 2023, a local cluster of 15 Zika cases was reported in a neighbourhood in Northeastern Singapore. The last significant local transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) with more than 450 cases was in 2016-2017. To monitor the situation and mitigate further transmission, case, entomological and wastewater-based surveillance were carried out. METHODS: Primary healthcare practitioners and the community were alerted to encourage timely case identification. Surveillance was enhanced through testing of Aedes mosquitoes collected from the National Gravitrap surveillance system, and wastewater samples were collected from a network of autosamplers deployed at manholes across the country. FINDINGS: ZIKV RNA was detected in mosquito pools (3/43; 7%) and individual mosquitoes (3/82; 3.7%) captured, and in wastewater samples (13/503) collected from the vicinity of the cluster of cases. Respective samples collected from other sites across the country were negative. The peak detection of ZIKV RNA in mosquitoes and wastewater coincided temporally with the peak in the number of cases in the area (15-25 May 2023). INTERPRETATION: The restriction of ZIKV signals from wastewater and mosquitoes within the neighbourhood suggested limited ZIKV transmission. The subsequent waning of signals suggested effectiveness of control measures. We demonstrate the utility of wastewater-based surveillance of ZIKV, which complements existing case- and entomological-based surveillance. The non-intrusive approach is particularly useful to monitor diseases such as Zika, which generally causes silent or mild infections, but may cause severe outcomes such as congenital Zika syndrome.

Urban transmission of mosquito-borne flaviviruses - a review of the risk for humans in Vietnam.,Nguyen-Tien T; Lundkvist Å; Lindahl J,"Vietnam is a tropical country where mosquito-borne diseases are common. This review explores the transmission of mosquito-borne flaviviruses in urban areas of Vietnam. It concludes that urban transmission has mainly been studied for Dengue virus, and so far, much less for Japanese encephalitis virus. Dengue is the most common flavivirus in Vietnam. Due to fast urbanization and favorable climatic conditions, the viral transmission concentrates mainly to large cities with high population density including Ha Noi, Nha Trang and Ho Chi Minh. Human cases of Japanese encephalitis have been controlled by an expanded immunization program. However, this virus is still circulating throughout the country, also in cities due to the pig rearing practices in urban and peri-urban areas. Zika virus is an additional major concern because it has long circulated in the Northern area and is now increasingly diagnosed in urban areas of the Central, Central Highlands and Southern regions using the same mosquito vectors as Dengue virus. There was alarge outbreak of Zika disease from 2016 to early 2017, with most infections observed in Ho Chi Minh city, the largest town in Vietnam.

Although outbreaks have been reported throughout Africa, only a few surveillance studies have been conducted in Gabon since the outbreaks of dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in 2010. Therefore, the current situation is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the presence of arboviruses, especially DENV (serotypes 1-4), CHIKV, and Zika virus (ZIKV), in Gabon, Central Africa. Between 2020 and 2021, we collected 1060 serum samples from febrile patients and screened them against viruses using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. We detected two DENV serotypes 1 (DENV-1), one CHIKV, and one ZIKV, and subsequently analyzed the genome sequences. To determine the genetic diversity and transmission route of the viruses, phylogenetic analysis was performed using complete or partial genome sequences. The DENV-1 and CHIKV strains detected in this study were closely related to the previous Gabonese strains, whereas the recent ZIKV strain was genetically different from a strain detected in 2007 in Gabon. This study provides new genomic information on DENV-1, CHIKV, and ZIKV that were detected in Gabon and insight into the circulation of the viruses in the country and their introduction from neighboring African countries.",2022,Dec,IJID Reg,5,,68-71,,10.1016/j.ijregi.2022.08.013,36200059,#12809,Ushijima 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
An Evaluation of Florida's Zika Response Using the WHO Health Systems Framework: Can We Apply These Lessons to COVID-19?,Marshall J; Scott B; Delva J; Ade C; Hernandez S; Patel J; Moreno-Cheek M; Rojas D; Tanner JP; Kirby RS,"OBJECTIVES: From 2016 to 2018 Florida documented 1471 cases of Zika virus, 299 of which were pregnant women (Florida Department of Health, https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-bornediseases/surveillance.html , 2019a). Florida's response required unprecedented rapid and continuous cross-sector communication, adaptation, and coordination. Zika tested public health systems in new ways, particularly for maternal child health populations. The systems are now being challenged again, as the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic spreads throughout Florida. This qualitative journey mapping evaluation of Florida's response focused on care for pregnant women and families with infants exposed to Zika virus. METHODS: Fifteen focus groups and interviews were conducted with 33 public health and healthcare workers who managed outbreak response, case investigations, and patient care in south Florida. Data were thematically analyzed, and the results were framed by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Healthcare Systems Framework of six building blocks: health service delivery, health workforce, health information systems, access to essential medicines, financing, and leadership and governance (World Health Organization, https://www.who.int/healthsystems/strategy/everybodys_business.pdf , 2007, https://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/monitoring/en/ , 2010). RESULTS: Results highlighted coordination of resources, essential services and treatment, data collection, communication among public health and healthcare systems, and dissemination of information. Community education, testing accuracy and turnaround time, financing, and continuity of health services were areas of need, and there was room for improvement in all indicator areas.

Transovarial transmission of mosquito-borne viruses: a systematic review.,Janjoter S; Kataria D; Yadav M; Dahiya N; Sehrawat N,"BACKGROUND: A number of mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs), such as dengue virus (DENV), zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) exert adverse health impacts on the global population. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are the prime vectors responsible for the transmission of these viruses. The viruses have acquired a number of routes for successful transmission, including horizontal and vertical transmission. Transovarial transmission is a subset/type of vertical transmission adopted by mosquitoes for the transmission of viruses from females to their offspring through eggs/ovaries. It provides a mechanism for these MBVs to persist and maintain their lineage during adverse climatic conditions of extremely hot and cold temperatures, during the dry season, or in the absence of susceptible vertebrate host when horizontal transmission is not possible. METHODS: The publications discussed in this systematic review were searched for using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, and websites such as those of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, using the search terms ""transovarial transmission"" and ""mosquito-borne viruses"" from 16 May 2023 to 20 September 2023. RESULTS: A total of 2,391 articles were searched, of which 123 were chosen for full text evaluation, and 60 were then included in the study after screening and removing duplicates. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review focuses on understanding the above diseases, their pathogenesis, epidemiology and host-parasite interactions.

GBS has an estimated lethality of 4% to 8%, even with effective treatment. Mexico is considered a hyperendemic country for DENV due to the circulation of four serotypes, and the ZIKV and CHIKV viruses have also been circulating in the country. The objective of this study was to predict the number of GBS cases in relation to the cumulative incidence of ZIKV / DENV / CHIKV in Mexico from 2014 to 2019. A six-year time series ecological study was carried out from GBS cases registered in the Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) Epidemiological Surveillance System (ESS), and DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV estimated cases from cases registered in the epidemiological vector-borne diseases surveillance system. The results shows that the incidence of GBS in Mexico is positively correlated with DENV and ZIKV. For every 1,000 estimated DENV cases, 1.45 GBS cases occurred on average, and for every 1,000 estimated ZIKV cases, 1.93 GBS cases occurred on average. A negative correlation between GBS and CHIKV estimated cases was found. The increase in the incidence of GBS cases in Mexico can be predicted by observing DENV and ZIKV cases through the epidemiological surveillance systems. These results can be useful in public health by providing the opportunity to improve capacities for the prevention of arbovirus diseases and for the timely procurement of supplies for the treatment of GBS.",2022,,PLOS Glob Public Health,2,3,e0000137,,10.1371/journal.pgph.0000137,36962143,#13015,Arriaga-Nieto 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
"Evidence of co-circulation of multiple arboviruses transmitted by Aedes species based on laboratory syndromic surveillance at a health unit in a slum of the Federal District, Brazil.",Rufalco-Moutinho P; de Noronha LAG; de Souza Cardoso Quintão T; Nobre TF; Cardoso APS; Cilião-Alves DC; Bellocchio Júnior MA; von Glehn MP; Haddad R; Romero GAS; de Araújo WN,"BACKGROUND: Vector-borne diseases, especially arboviruses transmitted by Aedes sp. mosquitos, should be a health policy priority in Brazil. Despite this urgency, there are significant limitations in the traditional surveillance system, mainly in vulnerable areas. This study aimed to investigate the circulation of dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV), and chikungunya viruses (CHIKV) by laboratory syndromic surveillance (LSS) in a slum area of the Federal District of Brazil, comparing the results with traditional surveillance data. METHODS: LSS for acute febrile and/or exanthematous symptoms was developed at a health unit of Cidade Estrutural, in order to identify the circulation of arboviruses transmitted by Aedes sp. mosquitos. Between June 2019 and March 2020, 131 valid participants were identified and sera tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for DENV (by serotype), ZIKV, and CHIKV acute infection and by immunoglobulin M enzyme-inked immunosorbent assay (ELISA-IgM) for DENV and CHIKV 15-21 days after symptom onset, when the participant reported no respiratory signs (cough and/or coryza). The results obtained were compared with traditional surveillance data for the study area and period. RESULTS: At least three DENV-1 (2.3%), four DENV-2 (3%), and one CHIKV (0.7%) cases were confirmed in the laboratory, showing evidence of hyperendemicity even though LSS had not reached the historic peak dengue fever months in the Federal District (April-May). When the results obtained here were compared with traditional surveillance, a significant discrepancy was observed, including underreporting of CHIKV infection. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the risks posed to the study population, the area investigated with its respective socio-environmental profile may be a potential site for spread of the virus, given the cosmopolitan presence of Aedes sp. and human mobility in the Federal District. It is also suggested that traditional epidemiological surveillance may be reporting acute viral infections other than DENV as dengue fever, while underreporting other arboviruses transmitted by Aedes sp. mosquitos in the Federal District.",2021,Dec,Parasit Vectors,14,1,610,,10.1186/s13071-021-05110-9,34924014,#13031,Rufalco-Moutinho 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

Clinical diagnosis of NMFI is hampered by unspecific symptoms, but early diagnosis is a key factor for both better patient care and disease control. The aim of this study was to determine the arboviral aetiologies of NMFI in low resource settings, using a mobile laboratory based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays. The panel of tests for this study was expanded to five arboviruses: dengue virus (DENV), zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and rift valley fever virus (RVFV). One hundred and four children aged between one month and 115 months were enrolled and screened. Three of the 104 blood samples of children <10 years presented at an outpatient clinic tested positive for DENV.

The World Health Organization's Disease Outbreak News: A retrospective database.,Carlson CJ; Boyce MR; Dunne M; Graeden E; Lin J; Abdellatif YO; Palys MA; Pavez M; Phelan AL; Katz R,"The World Health Organization (WHO) notifies the global community about disease outbreaks through the Disease Outbreak News (DON). These online reports tell important stories about both outbreaks themselves and the high-level decision making that governs information sharing during public health emergencies. However, they have been used only minimally in global health scholarship to date. Here, we collate all 2,789 of these reports from their first use through the start of the Covid-19 pandemic (January 1996 to December 2019), and develop an annotated database of the subjective and often inconsistent information they contain. We find that these reports are dominated by a mix of persistent worldwide threats (particularly influenza and cholera) and persistent epidemics (like Ebola virus disease in Africa or MERS-CoV in the Middle East), but also document important periods in history like the anthrax bioterrorist attacks at the turn of the century, the spread of chikungunya and Zika virus to the Americas, or even recent lapses in progress towards polio elimination. We present three simple vignettes that show how researchers can use these data to answer both qualitative and quantitative questions about global outbreak dynamics and public health response. However, we also find that the retrospective value of these reports is visibly limited by inconsistent reporting (e.g., of disease names, case totals, mortality, and actions taken to curtail spread). We conclude that sharing a transparent rubric for which outbreaks are considered reportable, and adopting more standardized formats for sharing epidemiological metadata, might help make the DON more useful to researchers and policymakers.",2023,,PLOS Glob Public Health,3,1,e0001083,,10.1371/journal.pgph.0001083,36962988,#13056,Carlson 2023,Exclusion reason: wrong pathogen or pathogen epidemiology or transmission not main focus; ,
Mosquito-Borne Arboviruses Occurrence and Distribution in the Last Three Decades in Central Africa: A Systematic Literature Review.,Poungou N; Sevidzem SL; Koumba AA; Koumba CRZ; Mbehang P; Onanga R; Zahouli JZB; Maganga GD; Djogbénou LS; Borrmann S; Adegnika AA; Becker SC; Mavoungou JF; Nguéma RM,"Arboviruses represent a real public health problem globally and in the Central African subregion in particular, which represents a high-risk zone for the emergence and re-emergence of arbovirus outbreaks. Furthermore, an updated review on the current arbovirus burden and associated mosquito vectors is lacking for this region. To contribute to filling this knowledge gap, the current study was designed with the following objectives: (i) to systematically review data on the occurrence and distribution of arboviruses and mosquito fauna; and (ii) to identify potential spillover mosquito species in the Central African region in the last 30 years. A web search enabled the documentation of 2454 articles from different online databases. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and the quality of reporting of meta-analyses (QUORUM) steps for a systematic review enabled the selection of 164 articles that fulfilled our selection criteria. Of the six arboviruses (dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), and West Nile virus (WNV)) of public health concern studied, the most frequently reported were chikungunya and dengue. The entomological records showed >248 species of mosquitoes regrouped under 15 genera, with Anopheles (n = 100 species), Culex (n = 56 species), and Aedes (n = 52 species) having high species diversity. Three genera were rarely represented, with only one species included, namely, Orthopodomyia, Lutzia, and Verrallina, but individuals of the genera Toxorhinchites and Finlayas were not identified at the species level. We found that two Aedes species (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) colonised the same microhabitat and were involved in major epidemics of the six medically important arboviruses, and other less-frequently identified mosquito genera consisted of competent species and were associated with outbreaks of medical and zoonotic arboviruses. The present study reveals a high species richness of competent mosquito vectors that could lead to the spillover of medically important arboviruses in the region. Although epidemiological studies were found, they were not regularly documented, and this also applies to vector competence and transmission studies. Future studies will consider unpublished information in dissertations and technical reports from different countries to allow their information to be more consistent.

The role of urbanisation in the spread of Aedes mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit-A systematic review.,Kolimenakis A; Heinz S; Wilson ML; Winkler V; Yakob L; Michaelakis A; Papachristos D; Richardson C; Horstick O,"BACKGROUND: This systematic review aims to assess how different urbanisation patterns related to rapid urban growth, unplanned expansion, and human population density affect the establishment and distribution of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and create favourable conditions for the spread of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted using the PubMed, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane, WHO Library Database (WHOLIS), Google Scholar, and and the Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS) databases. From a total of 523 identified studies, 86 were selected for further analysis, and 29 were finally analysed after applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main explanatory variables used to associate urbanisation with epidemiological/entomological outcomes were the following: human population density, urban growth, artificial geographical space, urban construction, and urban density. Associated with the lack of a global definition of urbanisation, several studies provided their own definitions, which represents one of the study's limitations. Results were based on 8 ecological studies/models, 8 entomological surveillance studies, 7 epidemiological surveillance studies, and 6 studies consisting of spatial and predictive models. According to their focus, studies were categorised into 2 main subgroups, namely ""Aedes ecology"" and ""transmission dynamics."" There was a consistent association between urbanisation and the distribution and density of Aedes mosquitoes in 14 of the studies and a strong relationship between vector abundance and disease transmission in 18 studies. Human population density of more than 1,000 inhabitants per square kilometer was associated with increased levels of arboviral diseases in 15 of the studies.

Arboviral diseases in pediatrics.,Martins MM; Prata-Barbosa A; Cunha AJLAD,"OBJECTIVES: To present the currently available evidence on transmission, clinical, diagnostic methods, treatment, and prevention methods of major arboviruses that occur in childhood. SOURCE OF DATA: Non-systematic review carried out in MEDLINE (PubMed), LILACS (VHL), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, CAPES Portal, and Google Scholar databases for the past five years using the search terms arboviruses, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro, and West Nile fever, as well as child, newborn, and adolescent. SYNTHESIS OF DATA: The main characteristic of arboviruses is the fact that part of their replication cycle occurs inside insect vectors, thus being classically transmitted to humans through the bite of mosquitoes (hematophagous arthropods), although non-vector transmission of these viruses is also possible in specific situations. These diseases remain a major public health challenge, due to the lack of specific antiviral treatment, the co-circulation of different arboviruses in endemic/epidemic regions, the lack of effective and safe immunizations for the vast majority of these viruses, and the great difficulty in vector control, especially in large urban centers.

We explored and analyzed the heterogeneity of confirmed cases of DENV (2010-2014 and 2015-2022) and ZIKV (2016-2017) during outbreaks in the San Juan metropolitan area of Puerto Rico to explore their degree of overlap and prioritize areas for Aedes aegypti control. Deidentified, georeferenced case data were aggregated into grid cells (500 × 500 m) within a geographical information system of the study area and analyzed to calculate the degree of overlap between outbreaks. Spatial autocorrelations using local indicators of spatial associations were conducted to identify significant disease case hot spots and correlations between outbreaks. We found that 75% of cases during the three transmission periods were concentrated in 25% of the total number of grid cells covering the study area. We also found significant clustering of cases during each outbreak, enabling identification of consistent disease hot spots. Our results showed 85% spatial overlap between cases of ZIKV in 2015-2017 and DENV in 2010-2014 and 97% overlap between DENV cases in 2010-2014 and 2015-2022. These results reveal urban areas at greater risk of future arbovirus outbreaks that should be prioritized for vector control.",2024,Feb,Am J Trop Med Hyg,,,,,10.4269/ajtmh.23-0627,38412550,#13292,Barrera 2024,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-12-04 23:56:07)(Select): outbreak info already published; ,
Review of the ecology and behaviour of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in Western Africa and implications for vector control.,Egid BR; Coulibaly M; Dadzie SK; Kamgang B; McCall PJ; Sedda L; Toe KH; Wilson AL,"Western Africa is vulnerable to arboviral disease transmission, having recently experienced major outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika. However, there have been relatively few studies on the natural history of the two major human arbovirus vectors in this region, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, potentially limiting the implementation of effective vector control. We systematically searched for and reviewed relevant studies on the behaviour and ecology of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Western Africa, published over the last 40 years. We identified 73 relevant studies, over half of which were conducted in Nigeria, Senegal, or Côte d'Ivoire. Most studies investigated the ecology of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, exploring the impact of seasonality and land cover on mosquito populations and identifying aquatic habitats. This review highlights the adaptation of Ae. albopictus to urban environments and its invasive potential, and the year-round maintenance of Ae. aegypti populations in water storage containers. However, important gaps were identified in the literature on the behaviour of both species, particularly Ae. albopictus. In Western Africa, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus appear to be mainly anthropophilic and to bite predominantly during the day, but further research is needed to confirm this to inform planning of effective vector control strategies. We discuss the public health implications of these findings and comment on the suitability of existing and novel options for control in Western Africa.",2022,,Curr Res Parasitol Vector Borne Dis,2,,100074,,10.1016/j.crpvbd.2021.100074,35726222,#13435,Egid 2022,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Liaisons dangereuses: cross-border gene flow and dispersal of insecticide resistance-associated genes in the mosquito Aedes aegypti from Brazil and French Guiana.,Salgueiro P; Restrepo-Zabaleta J; Costa M; Galardo AKR; Pinto J; Gaborit P; Guidez A; Martins AJ; Dusfour I,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, South America has suffered the burden of continuous high impact outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Aedes aegypti is the main mosquito vector of these arboviruses and its control is the only solution to reduce transmission. OBJECTIVES: In order to improve vector control it is essential to study mosquito population genetics in order to better estimate the population structures and the geneflow among them. METHODS: We have analysed microsatellites and knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations from a trans-border region in Amazonia between the state of Amapá (Brazil) and French Guiana (overseas territory of France), to provide further knowledge on these issues. These two countries have followed distinct vector control policies since last century. For population genetic analyses we evaluated variability in 13 well-established microsatellites loci in Ae. aegypti from French Guiana (Saint Georges and Cayenne) and Brazil (Oiapoque and Macapá). The occurrence and frequency of kdr mutations in these same populations were accessed by TaqMan genotype assays for the sites 1016 (Val/Ile) and 1534 (Phe/Cys). FINDINGS: We have detected high levels of gene flow between the closest cross-border samples of Saint-Georges and Oiapoque. These results suggest one common origin of re-colonisation for the populations of French Guiana and Oiapoque in Brazil, and a different source for Macapá, more similar to the other northern Brazilian populations. Genotyping of the kdr mutations revealed distinct patterns for Cayenne and Macapá associated with their different insecticide use history, and an admixture zone between these two patterns in Saint Georges and Oiapoque, in accordance with population genetic results. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the need for regional-local vector surveillance and transnational collaboration between neighboring countries to assess the impact of implemented vector control strategies, promote timely actions and develop preparedness plans.",2019,,Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,114,,e190120,,10.1590/0074-02760190120,31553370,#13478,Salgueiro 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-03-16 03:00:53)(Screen): might have mutation rates; ,
Inferring who-infected-whom-where in the 2016 Zika outbreak in Singapore-a spatio-temporal model.,Prem K; Lau MSY; Tam CC; Ho MZJ; Ng LC; Cook AR,"Singapore experienced its first known Zika outbreak in 2016. Given the lack of herd immunity, the suitability of the climate for pathogen transmission, and the year-round presence of the vector- Aedes aegypti-Zika had the potential to become endemic, like dengue. Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly are severe complications associated elsewhere with Zika and the risk of these complications makes understanding its spread imperative. We investigated the spatio-temporal spread of locally transmitted Zika in Singapore and assessed the relevance of non-residential transmission of Zika virus infections, by inferring the possible infection tree (i.e. who-infected-whom-where) and comparing inferences using geographically resolved data on cases' home, their work, or their home and work. We developed a spatio-temporal model using time of onset and both addresses of the Zika-confirmed cases between July and September 2016 to estimate the infection tree using Bayesian data augmentation. Workplaces were involved in a considerable fraction (64.2%) of infections, and homes and workplaces may be distant relative to the scale of transmission, allowing ambulant infected persons may act as the 'vector' infecting distant parts of the country. Contact tracing is a challenge for mosquito-borne diseases, but inferring the geographically structured transmission tree sheds light on the spatial transmission of Zika to immunologically naive regions of the country.",2019,Jun,J R Soc Interface,16,155,20180604,,10.1098/rsif.2018.0604,31213175,#17829,Prem 2019,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Assessing vulnerability for future Zika virus outbreaks using seroprevalence data and environmental suitability maps.,Roell Y; Pezzi L; Lozano-Parra A; Olson D; Messina J; Quandelacy T; Drexler JF; Brady O; Karimzadeh M; Jaenisch T,"The 2015-17 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas subsided faster than expected and evolving population immunity was postulated to be the main reason. Herd immunization is suggested to occur around 60-70% seroprevalence, depending on demographic density and climate suitability. However, herd immunity was only documented for a few cities in South America, meaning a substantial portion of the population might still be vulnerable to a future Zika virus outbreak. The aim of our study was to determine the vulnerability of populations to ZIKV by comparing the environmental suitability of ZIKV transmission to the observed seroprevalence, based on published studies. Using a systematic search, we collected seroprevalence and geospatial data for 119 unique locations from 37 studies. Extracting the environmental suitability at each location and converting to a hypothetical expected seroprevalence, we were able to determine the discrepancy between observed and expected. This discrepancy is an indicator of vulnerability and divided into three categories: high risk, low risk, and very low risk. The vulnerability was used to evaluate the level of risk that each location still has for a ZIKV outbreak to occur. Of the 119 unique locations, 69 locations (58%) fell within the high risk category, 47 locations (39%) fell within the low risk category, and 3 locations (3%) fell within the very low risk category. The considerable heterogeneity between environmental suitability and seroprevalence potentially leaves a large population vulnerable to future infection. Vulnerability seems to be especially pronounced at the fringes of the environmental suitability for ZIKV (e.g. Sao Paulo, Brazil). The discrepancies between observed and expected seroprevalence raise the question: ""why did the ZIKV epidemic stop with large populations unaffected?"". This lack of understanding also highlights that future ZIKV outbreaks currently cannot be predicted with confidence.",2024,Mar,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,18,3,e0012017,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0012017,38517912,#17946,Roell 2024,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-11-14 22:59:26)(Select): risk factors for sero; ,
Impact of extrinsic incubation temperature on natural selection during Zika virus infection of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.,Murrieta RA; Garcia-Luna SM; Murrieta DJ; Halladay G; Young MC; Fauver JR; Gendernalik A; Weger-Lucarelli J; Rückert C; Ebel GD,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) require replication across a wide range of temperatures to perpetuate. While vertebrate hosts tend to maintain temperatures of approximately 37°C-40°C, arthropods are subject to ambient temperatures which can have a daily fluctuation of > 10°C. Temperatures impact vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival unimodally, with optimal conditions occurring at some intermediate temperature. In addition, the mean and range of daily temperature fluctuations influence arbovirus perpetuation and vector competence. The impact of temperature on arbovirus genetic diversity during systemic mosquito infection, however, is poorly understood. Therefore, we determined how constant extrinsic incubation temperatures of 25°C, 28°C, 32°C, and 35°C control Zika virus (ZIKV) vector competence and population dynamics within Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. We also examined fluctuating temperatures which better mimic field conditions in the tropics. We found that vector competence varied in a unimodal manner for constant temperatures peaking between 28°C and 32°C for both Aedes species. Transmission peaked at 10 days post-infection for Aedes aegypti and 14 days for Aedes albopictus. Conversely, fluctuating temperature decreased vector competence. Using RNA-seq to characterize ZIKV population structure, we identified that temperature alters the selective environment in unexpected ways. During mosquito infection, constant temperatures more often elicited positive selection whereas fluctuating temperatures led to strong purifying selection in both Aedes species. These findings demonstrate that temperature has multiple impacts on ZIKV biology, including major effects on the selective environment within mosquitoes.",2021,Nov,PLoS Pathog,17,11,e1009433,,10.1371/journal.ppat.1009433,34752502,#18093,Murrieta 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,

"Epidemiological, virological and clinical characterization of a Dengue/Zika outbreak in the Caribbean region of Costa Rica 2017-2018.",Soto-Garita C; Murillo T; Chávez-Peraza I; Campos-Ávila J; Prado-Hidalgo G; Drexler JF; Moreira-Soto A; Corrales-Aguilar E,"The increase in incidence and geographical expansion of viruses transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes, such as dengue (DENV) and zika (ZIKV) in the Americas, represents a burden for healthcare systems in tropical and subtropical regions. These and other under-detected arboviruses co-circulate in Costa Rica, adding additional complexity to their management due to their shared epidemiological behavior and similarity of symptoms in early stages. Since diagnostics of febrile illness is mostly based on clinical symptoms alone, we gathered acute-phase serum and urine from 399 samples of acute dengue-like cases from two healthcare facilities of Costa Rica, during an outbreak of arboviruses from July 2017 to May 2018, and tested them using molecular and serological methods. The analyses showed that of the clinically presumptive arbovirus cases that were reported, only 39.4% (n=153) of the samples were confirmed positive by RT-PCR to be DENV (DENV (10.3%), CHIKV (0.2%), ZIKV (27.3%), or mixed infections (1.5%). RT-PCR for other alphaviruses and flaviviruses, and PCR for Leptospira sp were negative. Furthermore, to assess flavivirus positivity in post-acute patients, the negative sera were tested against Dengue-IgM. 20% of sera were found positive, confounding even more the definitive number of cases, and emphasizing the need of several distinct diagnostic tools for accurate diagnostics. Molecular characterization of the prM and E genes from isolated viruses revealed that the American/Asian genotype of DENV-2 and the Asian lineage of ZIKV were circulating during this outbreak. Two different clades of DENV-2 American/Asian genotype were identified to co-circulate in the same region and a difference in the platelet and leukocyte count was noted between people infected with each clade, suggesting a putative distinct virulence. Our study sheds light on the necessity for healthcare strategies in managing arbovirus outbreaks, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive molecular and serological diagnostic approaches, as well as molecular characterization. This approach aids in enhancing our understanding of the clinical and epidemiological aspects of arboviral diseases during outbreaks.

The risk of transmission of arboviruses through this route has become apparent in recent years. The aim of our study is to summarise the reported prevalence (viraemic rate, seroprevalence and/or antigen detection) of Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses in blood donors according to screening test used and world region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis having searched for information in the main bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus). The prevalence for each of the viruses was calculated according to the screening test used and geographic location. RESULTS: We included 18 records on CHIKV, 71 on DENV, and 27 on ZIKV. The highest prevalences of RNA for CHIKV were 1.9% in Puerto Rico (2014), 1.0% in Thailand (2009), and 1.0% in French Polynesia (2014-15). The highest prevalences of RNA for DENV were 5.5% in Saudi Arabia (2015-16), 2.3% in Madeira, Portugal (2012-13), and 0.6% in Brazil (2012). The highest prevalences of RNA for ZIKV were 2.8% in French Polynesia (2013-14), 2.7% in Brazil (2015-16), and 1.8% in Martinique (2016). Overall seroprevalence, as assessed by IgG antibodies, was 21.6% for CHIKV, 24.0% for DENV, and 5.1% for ZIKV. DISCUSSION: Our study shows a high proportion of donors who are viraemic and asymptomatic, especially during outbreaks, with prevalences surpassing 5% for DENV, 1% for CHIKV, and 2% for ZIKV. These data confirm a clear threat to blood transfusion safety. The elevated seroprevalence for these three arboviruses is also indicative of their wide circulation in populations, correlating with an increased risk of infected but asymptomatic donors.

Global seroprevalence of Zika virus in asymptomatic individuals: A systematic review.,Saba Villarroel PM; Hamel R; Gumpangseth N; Yainoy S; Koomhin P; Missé D; Wichit S,"BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread to five of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions. Given the substantial number of asymptomatic infections and clinical presentations resembling those of other arboviruses, estimating the true burden of ZIKV infections is both challenging and essential. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of seroprevalence studies of ZIKV IgG in asymptomatic population to estimate its global impact and distribution. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted extensive searches and compiled a collection of articles published from Jan/01/2000, to Jul/31/2023, from Embase, Pubmed, SciELO, and Scopus databases. The random effects model was used to pool prevalences, reported with their 95% confidence interval (CI), a tool to assess the risk of study bias in prevalence studies, and the I2 method for heterogeneity (PROSPERO registration No. CRD42023442227). Eighty-four studies from 49 countries/territories, with a diversity of study designs and serological tests were included. The global seroprevalence of ZIKV was 21.0% (95%CI 16.1%-26.4%). Evidence of IgG antibodies was identified in all WHO regions, except for Europe. Seroprevalence correlated with the epidemics in the Americas (39.9%, 95%CI:30.0-49.9), and in some Western Pacific countries (15.6%, 95%CI:8.2-24.9), as well as with recent and past circulation in Southeast Asia (22.8%, 95%CI:16.5-29.7), particularly in Thailand. Additionally, sustained low circulation was observed in Africa (8.4%, 95%CI:4.8-12.9), except for Gabon (43.7%), and Burkina Faso (22.8%). Although no autochthonous transmission was identified in the Eastern Mediterranean, a seroprevalence of 16.0% was recorded. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The study highlights the high heterogeneity and gaps in the distribution of seroprevalence. The implementation of standardized protocols and the development of tests with high specificity are essential for ensuring a valid comparison between studies.

Neurodevelopment in preschool children exposed and unexposed to Zika virus in utero in Nicaragua: a prospective cohort study.,Max R; Toval-Ruiz C; Becker-Dreps S; Gajewski AM; Martinez E; Cross K; Blette B; Ortega O; Collado D; Zepeda O; Familiar I; Boivin MJ; Chavarria M; Meléndez MJ; Mercado JC; de Silva A; Collins MH; Westreich D; Bos S; Harris E; Balmaseda A; Gower EW; Bowman NM; Stringer E; Bucardo F,"BACKGROUND: Data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of normocephalic children (born with normal head circumference) exposed to Zika virus in utero are scarce. We aimed to compare neurodevelopmental outcomes in normocephalic children up to age 48 months with and without Zika virus exposure in utero. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we included infants from two cohorts of normocephalic children born in León and Managua, Nicaragua during the 2016 Zika epidemic. In León, all women pregnant during the two enrolment periods were eligible. In Managua, mother-child pairs were included from three districts in the municipality of Managua: all women who became pregnant before June 15, 2016, and had a due date of Sept 15, 2016 or later were eligible. Infants were serologically classified as Zika virus-exposed or Zika virus-unexposed in utero and were followed up prospectively until age 48 months. At 36 months and 48 months of age, the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) assessment was administered. Primary outcomes were MSEL early learning composite (ELC) scores at 30-48 months in León and 36-48 months in Managua. We used an inverse probability weighting generalised estimating equations model to assess the effect of Zika virus exposure on individual MSEL cognitive domain scores and ELC scores, adjusted for maternal education and age, poverty status, and infant sex. FINDINGS: The initial enrolment period for the León cohort was between Jan 31 and April 5, 2017 and the second was between Aug 30, 2017, and Feb 22, 2018. The enrolment period for the Managua cohort was between Oct 24, 2019, and May 5, 2020. 478 mothers (482 infants) from the León cohort and 615 mothers (609 infants) from the Managua cohort were enrolled, of whom 622 children (303 from the León cohort; 319 from the Managua cohort) were included in the final analysis; four children had microcephaly at birth and thus were excluded from analyses, two from each cohort. 33 (11%) of 303 children enrolled in León and 219 (69%) of 319 children enrolled in Managua were exposed to Zika virus in utero. In both cohorts, no significant differences were identified in adjusted mean ELC scores between Zika virus-exposed and unexposed infants at 36 months (between-group difference 1·2 points [95% CI -4·2 to 6·5] in the León cohort; 2·8 [-2·4 to 8·1] in the Managua cohort) or at 48 months (-0·9 [-10·8 to 8·8] in the León cohort; 0·1 [-5·1 to 5·2] in the Managua cohort). No differences in ELC scores between Zika virus-exposed and unexposed infants exceeded 6 points at any time between 30 months and 48 months in León or between 36 months and 48 months in Managua, which was considered clinically significant in other settings. INTERPRETATION: We found no significant differences in neurodevelopmental scores between normocephalic children with in-utero Zika virus exposure and Zika virus-unexposed children at age 36 months or 48 months. These findings are promising, supporting typical neurodevelopment in Zika virus-exposed normocephalic children, although additional follow-up and research is warranted.

A Gaussian-process approximation to a spatial SIR process using moment closures and emulators.,Trostle P; Guinness J; Reich BJ,"The dynamics that govern disease spread are hard to model because infections are functions of both the underlying pathogen as well as human or animal behavior. This challenge is increased when modeling how diseases spread between different spatial locations. Many proposed spatial epidemiological models require trade-offs to fit, either by abstracting away theoretical spread dynamics, fitting a deterministic model, or by requiring large computational resources for many simulations. We propose an approach that approximates the complex spatial spread dynamics with a Gaussian process. We first propose a flexible spatial extension to the well-known SIR stochastic process, and then we derive a moment-closure approximation to this stochastic process. This moment-closure approximation yields ordinary differential equations for the evolution of the means and covariances of the susceptibles and infectious through time. Because these ODEs are a bottleneck to fitting our model by MCMC, we approximate them using a low-rank emulator. This approximation serves as the basis for our hierarchical model for noisy, underreported counts of new infections by spatial location and time.

Urban arbovirus exposure in blood donations from an endemic area of Brazil.,de Sant'Anna RR; Nunes PCG; Dos Santos FB,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In Brazil, urban arboviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), constitute a major public health problem, and due to their endemicity and asymptomatic cases, they pose a potential threat to blood donations. Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brazil, has been impacted by extensive DENV epidemics over the last 30 years and, after 2015, by CHIKV and ZIKV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urban arboviruses DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV were investigated in blood donations (n = 778) at the State Institute of Hematology, HEMORIO (RJ) from 2019 to 2022 by serological and molecular methods. RESULTS: An overall arbovirus exposure was observed in 26.1% of the blood donations. Anti-DENV IgM was detected in 4.0% of samples and two donations were DENV NS1 positive. Positive anti-CHIKV IgM was observed in 4.7% of the donations. Co-detection of anti-CHIKV IgM and anti-DENV IgM was observed in 1.0% of donors, and CHIKV prevalence was 21.3%. All blood donations tested were negative for the DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV RNA. CONCLUSION: IgM seroprevalence to the arboviruses analyzed here is an indicator of recent infection in asymptomatic donors, showing that the population of blood donors can be a vehicle for new infections, especially during epidemic periods.",2024,Sep,Vox Sang,119,9,1006-1011,,10.1111/vox.13707,38970294,#21339,deSant'Anna 2024,"Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-11-19 18:26:36)(Select): it says ""Due to the extensive serological cross-reactivity of commercially available ZIKV kits with dengue, the diagnosis of ZIKV was based solely on molecular detection."" e.g. didn't test for zika sero; Extractor (2024-11-18 17:39:06)(Select): zero seropositivity for Zika; ",
Clinical spectrum of congenital Zika virus infection in Brazil: Update and issues for research development.,Martelli CMT; Cortes F; Brandão-Filho SP; Turchi MD; Souza WV; Araújo TVB; Ximenes RAA; Miranda-Filho DB,"This review aimed to provide an update on the morphological and/or functional abnormalities related to congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, based on primary data from studies conducted in Brazil since 2015. During the epidemic years (2015-2016), case series and pediatric cohort studies described several birth defects, including severe and/or disproportionate microcephaly, cranial bone overlap, skull collapse, congenital contractures (arthrogryposis and/or clubfoot), and visual and hearing abnormalities, as part of the spectrum of Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). Brain imaging abnormalities, mainly cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, and calcifications, serve as structural markers of CZS severity. Most case series and cohorts of microcephaly have reported the co-occurrence of epilepsy, dysphagia, orthopedic deformities, motor function impairment, cerebral palsy, and urological impairment. A previous large meta-analysis conducted in Brazil revealed that a confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy was associated with a 4% risk of microcephaly. Additionally, one-third of children showed at least one abnormality, predominantly identified in isolation. Studies examining antenatally ZIKV-exposed children without detectable abnormalities at birth reported conflicting neurodevelopmental results. Therefore, long-term follow-up studies involving pediatric cohorts with appropriate control groups are needed to address this knowledge gap. We recognize the crucial role of a national network of scientists collaborating with international research institutions in understanding the lifelong consequences of congenital ZIKV infection. Additionally, we highlight the need to provide sustainable resources for research and development to reduce the risk of future Zika outbreaks.",2024,,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,57,,e00301,,10.1590/0037-8682-0153-2024,39082517,#21427,MartelliCMT 2024,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review
Associations between the social environment and early childhood developmental outcomes of Puerto Rican children with prenatal Zika virus exposure: a cross-sectional study.,Rodríguez-Rabassa M; Appleton AA; Rosario-Villafañe V; Repollet-Carrer I; Borges-Rodríguez M; Dedós-Peña L; González M; Velázquez-González P; Muniz-Rodriguez K; Mántaras-Ortiz C; Rivera-Amill V; Olivieri-Ramos O; Alvarado-Domenech LI,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to the Zika virus can lead to microcephaly and adverse developmental outcomes, even in children without evident birth defects. The social environment plays a crucial role in infant health and developmental trajectories, especially during periods of heightened brain plasticity. The study aimed to assess socioenvironmental factors as predictors of developmental outcomes of 36-month-old children exposed to Zika virus prenatally. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included 53 mothers and 55 children enrolled in the Pediatric Outcomes of Prenatal Zika Exposure cohort study in Puerto Rico. The study performs follow-up developmental assessments of children born to mothers with confirmed and probable Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Mothers completed socioenvironmental questionnaires (e.g., Perceived Neighborhood Scale and US Household Food Insecurity Survey). Children's developmental outcomes were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development: Third Edition, the Ages and Stages Questionnaires: Third Edition, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-Socioemotional: Second Edition, and the Child Adjustment and Parent Efficacy Scale. RESULTS: Linear regression models, adjusting for a child's sex and age and maternal education, revealed that early life exposure to food insecurity and maternal pregnancy stressors were significantly associated with poorer developmental outcomes in Zika virus-exposed children at 36 months of age. Maternal resilience representation of adaptive ability was associated with the preservation of adequate developmental outcomes in children. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy and early childhood are critical life periods for ensuring optimal brain development in children. While the mechanisms in the interaction of children with their environment are complex, the risk and protective factors identified in the study are modifiable through public policy and preventive initiatives. Implementation of comprehensive strategies that improve access to social support programs, educational and nutritional interventions, and mental health services during pregnancy and early childhood can enhance the developmental potential of vulnerable children.",2024,May,BMC Pediatr,24,1,342,,10.1186/s12887-024-04806-y,38755525,#22070,Rodríguez-Rabassa 2024,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Cohort study: Neurological and cognitive-behavioral sequelae of acquired Zika virus infection among Nicaraguan children.,Lebov JF; LaForett DR; Gajewski A; Browne EN; Zambrana JV; Balmaseda A; Harris E; Hooper SR,"BACKGROUND: ZIKV has neuroinvasive properties, and in utero exposure can cause birth defects, but little is known about the neurological and neurocognitive impacts of acquired ZIKV infection, particularly in children. METHODS: We assessed neurological symptoms frequency among ZIKV-infected children within one year after ZIKV infection. Three to 5 years post-infection, these children and a matched group of uninfected children were assessed via questionnaires, neurological exams, and neuropsychological testing to evaluate the association between prior ZIKV infection and subsequent neurological symptoms, and cognitive-behavioral function. RESULTS: Among 194 ZIKV-infected children, 3 reported asthenia, 4 reported neck pain, and 10 reported back pain within one year post-infection. At follow-up, clinician-observed cranial nerve abnormalities were significantly more common among ZIKV-infected vs. uninfected children (16 vs. 3; p < 0.01), with vestibulocochlear nerve abnormalities observed most frequently. While ZIKV-infected children scored better than uninfected on cognitive measures, this difference was not clinically meaningful. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological signs, including paresthesia and cranial nerve abnormalities, were observed among ZIKV-infected participants in our study. However, we did not observe a meaningful link between acquired ZIKV infection and subsequent neurological, cognitive, or behavioral outcomes in a representative sample. An exception may be hearing impairment and loss, which should be explored further in future studies. IMPACT: Neurological symptoms, though rare, were observed and reported more frequently among ZIKV-infected vs. uninfected children. These included: asthenia, neck pain, back pain, paresthesia, and cranial nerve abnormalities. Neurocognitive and behavioral test scores were similar among ZIKV-infected and uninfected children. Our study suggests that ZIKV-infected children should be monitored for neurological symptoms and cranial neuropathy to better understand the full burden of acquired ZIKV infection among children.",2024,Jul,Pediatr Res,,,,,10.1038/s41390-024-03160-0,38956218,#23042,Lebov 2024,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; ,
Original Article: Decline of notified dengue infections in Indonesia in 2017: Discussion of the possible determinants.,Dhewantara PW; Jamil KF; Fajar JK; Saktianggi PP; Nusa R; Garjito TA; Anwar S; Nainu F; Megawati D; Sasmono RT; Mudatsir M,"This study was conducted to quantify the trend in dengue notifications in the country in 2017 and to explore the possible determinants. Annual nation-wide dengue notification data were obtained from the National Disease Surveillance of Ministry of Health of Indonesia. Annual incidence rate (IR) and case fatality rate (CFR) in 2017 and the previous years were quantified and compared. Correlations between annual larva free index (LFI), implementation coverage of integrated vector management (IVM), El Niño Southern Oscillation (Niño3.4), Dipole Mode Index (DMI), Zika virus seropositivity and the percent change in IR and CFR of dengue were examined. The change of dengue IR and CFRs were mapped. In 2017, dengue IR was declined by 71% (22.55 per 100,000 population) compared to 2016 (77.96 per 100,000 population) while the CFR was slightly reduced from 0.79% to 0.75%. Reduction in IR and CFR occurred in 94.1% and 70.1% out of 34 provinces, respectively. The trend of dengue IR seems to be influenced by Niño3.4 but there is no clear evidence that Niño3.4 is the main reason for dengue reduction in 2017. It is difficult to elucidate that the reduction of dengue in 2017 was associated with previous Zika outbreaks. In conclusion, there was a significant reduction on dengue notifications in Indonesia in 2017. Further investigation is needed to look at the role of climate on the decline of dengue IR at finer temporal scale. In addition, study on the role of cross-protective immunity generated by Zika infection on dengue incidence is also warranted.",2021,Apr,Narra J,1,1,e23,,10.52225/narraj.v1i1.23,38449778,#23044,Dhewantara 2021,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-11-06 23:16:52)(Screen): chcek on sero?; ,

The first autochthonous case of Zika in the Caribbean was reported by Suriname in November 2015, and the virus subsequently spread rapidly throughout the region. Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) member states (CMS) reported clinically suspected cases of Zika and submitted serum specimens to the agency for laboratory investigation. A patient was considered a confirmed case if Zika virus was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or serological test. Due to the documented link between 1) Zika virus and congenital syndrome, and 2) Zika virus and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), data on both of these disease outcomes were extracted from country and regional reports.

Spatio-temporal dynamics of three diseases caused by Aedes-borne arboviruses in Mexico.,Dong B; Khan L; Smith M; Trevino J; Zhao B; Hamer GL; Lopez-Lemus UA; Molina AA; Lubinda J; Nguyen UDT; Haque U,"BACKGROUND: The intensity of transmission of Aedes-borne viruses is heterogeneous, and multiple factors can contribute to variation at small spatial scales. Illuminating drivers of heterogeneity in prevalence over time and space would provide information for public health authorities. The objective of this study is to detect the spatiotemporal clusters and determine the risk factors of three major Aedes-borne diseases, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) clusters in Mexico. METHODS: We present an integrated analysis of Aedes-borne diseases (ABDs), the local climate, and the socio-demographic profiles of 2469 municipalities in Mexico. We used SaTScan to detect spatial clusters and utilize the Pearson correlation coefficient, Randomized Dependence Coefficient, and SHapley Additive exPlanations to analyze the influence of socio-demographic and climatic factors on the prevalence of ABDs. We also compare six machine learning techniques, including XGBoost, decision tree, Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function kernel, K nearest neighbors, random forest, and neural network to predict risk factors of ABDs clusters. RESULTS: DENV is the most prevalent of the three diseases throughout Mexico, with nearly 60.6% of the municipalities reported having DENV cases. For some spatiotemporal clusters, the influence of socio-economic attributes is larger than the influence of climate attributes for predicting the prevalence of ABDs. XGBoost performs the best in terms of precision-measure for ABDs prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Both socio-demographic and climatic factors influence ABDs transmission in different regions of Mexico. Future studies should build predictive models supporting early warning systems to anticipate the time and location of ABDs outbreaks and determine the stand-alone influence of individual risk factors and establish causal mechanisms.",2022,,Commun Med (Lond),2,,134,,10.1038/s43856-022-00192-7,36317054,#23300,Dong 2022,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); Extractor (2024-11-20 23:43:51)(Select): zika outbreak data ; ,
"[Reporting of birth defects from the Zika outbreak in Colombia, 2015-2017Notificação de defeitos congênitos associados ao surto de vírus zika na Colômbia, 2015-2017].",Mendivelso Duarte FO; Robayo García A; Rodríguez Bedoya M; Suárez Rángel G,"OBJECTIVE: The Zika outbreak affected several tropical countries in 2015 and 2016, requiring the creation of intensified surveillance strategies for microcephaly and other neurological syndromes. The effect of the Zika outbreak on the reporting of birth defects in Colombia was evaluated from the perspective of the national surveillance system. METHODS: National reporting of newborns with different birth defects was analyzed; variations in reporting attributed to the epidemic were determined through difference in differences (DID), a semiparametric model. RESULTS: During the period of study, 18,234 cases of birth defects were reported in Colombia. The majority were congenital malformations (91.9%), and 82.3% was confirmed by clinical diagnosis or epidemiological link. In the case of microcephaly, eight new cases per epidemiological week were reported (coefficient of case reporting [D] = 8.8; P = 0.000) and 32 cases from other congenital anatomical malformations (D = 32.0; P = 0.000). The absolute value of the difference in differences estimator attributed to the Zika outbreak increased weekly case reporting of microcephaly (DID = |-5.0|; P = 0.008) and congenital malformations (DID = |-12.0|; P = 0.111).

"Exploring the urban arbovirus landscape in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: transmission dynamics and patterns of disease spread.",Schuab G; Tosta S; Moreno K; Fonseca V; Santos LA; Slavov SN; Kashima S; Ciccozzi M; Lourenço J; Cella E; de Oliveira C; Cavalcanti AC; Junior Alcantara LC; de Bruycker-Nogueira F; Bispo de Filippis AM; Giovanetti M,"BACKGROUND: This study focuses on urban arboviruses, specifically dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV), which pose a significant public health challenge in Rio de Janeiro state, Southeast Brazil. In our research, we highlight critical findings on the transmission dynamics of these arboviruses in Rio de Janeiro, identifying distinct patterns of disease spread. METHODS: By combining genomic data with case reports from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we have analysed the phylogenetics, prevalence and spatial distribution of these endemic viruses within the state. FINDINGS: Our results revealed sustained DENV transmission primarily in the northern part of the state, a significant ZIKV epidemic in 2016 affecting all mesoregions, and two major CHIKV outbreaks in 2018 and 2019, predominantly impacting the northern and southern areas. Our analysis suggests an inverse relationship between arboviral case incidence and urban density, with less populous regions experiencing higher transmission rates, potentially attributed to a complex interplay of factors such as the efficacy of vector control measures, environmental conditions, local immunity levels, and human mobility. Furthermore, our investigation unveiled distinct age and gender trends among affected individuals. Notably, dengue cases were predominantly observed in young adults aged 32, while chikungunya cases were more prevalent among individuals over 41. In contrast, cases of ZIKV were concentrated around the 33-year age group. Intriguingly, females accounted for nearly 60% of the cases, suggesting a potential gender-based difference in infection rates. INTERPRETATION: Our findings underscore the complexity of arbovirus transmission and the need for interventions tailored to different geographical mesoregions. Enhanced surveillance and genomic sequencing will be essential for a deeper, more nuanced understanding of regional arbovirus dynamics. Identifying potential blind spots within the state will be pivotal for developing and implementing more effective public health strategies, specifically designed to address the unique challenges posed by these viruses throughout the state.

Impacts of climate change on water-related mosquito-borne diseases in temperate regions: A systematic review of literature and meta-analysis.,Gizaw Z; Salubi E; Pietroniro A; Schuster-Wallace CJ,"Mosquito-borne diseases are a known tropical phenomenon. This review was conducted to assess the mecha-nisms through which climate change impacts mosquito-borne diseases in temperate regions. Articles were searched from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase databases. Identification criteria were scope (climate change and mosquito-borne diseases), region (temperate), article type (peer-reviewed), publication language (English), and publication years (since 2015). The WWH (who, what, how) framework was applied to develop the research question and thematic analyses identified the mechanisms through which climate change affects mosquito-borne diseases. While temperature ranges for disease transmission vary per mosquito species, all are viable for temperate regions, particularly given projected temperature increases. Zika, chikungunya, and dengue transmission occurs between 18-34 °C (peak at 26-29 °C). West Nile virus establishment occurs at monthly average temperatures between 14-34.3 °C (peak at 23.7-25 °C). Malaria establishment occurs when the consecutive average daily temperatures are above 16 °C until the sum is above 210 °C. The identified mechanisms through which climate change affects the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in temperate regions include: changes in the development of vectors and pathogens; changes in mosquito habitats; extended transmission seasons; changes in geographic spread; changes in abundance and behaviors of hosts; reduced abundance of mosquito predators; interruptions to control operations; and influence on other non-climate factors. Process and stochastic approaches as well as dynamic and spatial models exist to predict mosquito population dynamics, disease transmission, and climate favorability. Future projections based on the observed relations between climate factors and mosquito-borne diseases suggest that mosquito-borne disease expansion is likely to occur in temperate regions due to climate change. While West Nile virus is already established in some temperate regions, Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and malaria are also likely to become established over time. Moving forward, more research is required to model future risks by incorporating climate, environmental, sociodemographic, and mosquito-related factors under changing climates.",2024,Oct,Acta Trop,258,,107324,,10.1016/j.actatropica.2024.107324,39009235,#23873,Gizaw 2024,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

Zika virus infection in Peru: from threat to a health problem,"Aspilcueta-Gho, D; Villafane, CB; Sánchez, MMC; Yberico, JGC","The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has emerged as a significant threat in the region of the Americas, especially for pregnant women. Recent outbreaks in Central and South America have been associated with an increase in the incidence of microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities in newborns. There is a causal link between Zika infection during pregnancy and microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The region faces a probable epidemic with potential consequences for pregnant women and newborns. The epidemiology of the Zika virus, its threat to pregnancy, clinical consequences and impact on public health are reviewed. A number of features of the mechanisms of infection and dissemination sustain preventive interventions, diagnosis and management of the disease. It is important to intensify its epidemiological surveillance, and to work on prevention and an adequate management response in pregnant women with a presumptive diagnosis or with a Zika virus infection. Its presence has been demonstrated in several regions of Peru. Until December 2016, infection had been confirmed in 61 pregnant women, particularly in Jaen, Cajamarca, with 36 cases.

Challenger Treats Zika Virus,"Carvalho, KI; Watanabe, CM; Kallas, EG","Purpose of review Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are zoonotic, and the common vectors are ticks and hematophagous mosquitoes. Currently, dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis virus infections have been causing worldwide concerns. In 2015, a large outbreak was documented with another mosquito-borne flavivirus, the Zika virus (ZIKV), and ravaging South and Central Americas and the Caribbean. ZIKV was declaring a public health emergency, because of the clinical evidence neurological complications. Recent findings The flavivirus infection is difficult to differentiate only with clinical manifestation. It has been reported 2366 cases of microcephaly or congenital defects associated with ZIKV in Brazil, and the mechanism or processes that lead to these neurological complications are still under investigation. No antivirals are available to treat ZIKV infection, leading to no option to prevent the fetal infection during pregnancy which could avoid the congenital Zika syndrome. In this review, we will describe the drugs that are being tested in vitro and in animal models against ZIKV. We reviewed several publications that test the compounds for the treatment of ZIKV disease. We conclude that some of these compounds testing in vitro and in vivo have shown a therapeutic possibilities to consider and to be test in pregnancy and in individuals with high risk of infection.",2018,,CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES,10,2,217-228,WOS:000526795800008,10.1007/s40506-018-0160-1,,#24799,Carvalho 2018,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Review

Perceiving the ZIKA associated losses, in 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global public health emergency. In consequence, an upsurge in the research on ZIKV was seen around the globe, with significant attainments over developing several effective diagnostics, drugs, therapies, and vaccines countering this life-threatening virus at an early step. State-of-art tools developed led the researchers to explore virus at the molecular level, and in-depth epidemiological investigations to understand the reason for increased pathogenicity and different clinical manifestations. These days, ZIKV infection is diagnosed based on clinical manifestations, along with serological and molecular detection tools. As, isolation of ZIKV is a tedious task; molecular assays such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time qRT-PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), lateral flow assays (LFAs), biosensors, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) tests, strand invasion-based amplification tests and immune assays like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are in-use to ascertain the ZIKV infection or Zika fever. Herein, this review highlights the recent advances in the diagnosis, surveillance, and monitoring of ZIKV. These new insights gained from the recent advances can aid in the rapid and definitive detection of this virus and/or Zika fever.

Viral Determinants and Vector Competence of Zika Virus,"Tham, HW; Balasubramaniam, V; Ooi, MK; Chew, MF","Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a new global health threat. Since its first discovery in Zika forest in Uganda, this virus has been isolated from several mosquito species, including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The geographical distribution of these mosquito species across tropical and subtropical regions has led to several outbreaks, including the recent pandemic in Brazil, followed by the Pacific islands and other areas of North and South America. This has gained attention of the scientific community to elucidate the epidemiology and transmission of ZIKV. Despite its strong attention on clinical aspects for healthcare professionals, the relationships between ZIKV and its principal vectors, A. aegypti and A. albopictus, have not gained substantial interest in the scientific research community. As such, this review aims to summarize the current knowledge on ZIKV tropism and some important mechanisms which may be employed by the virus for effective strategies on viral survival in mosquitoes.

While ZIKV infection is usually asymptomatic, it may cause a non-specific illness with fever, rash, myalgia, headache, and/or non-purulent conjunctivitis. Additionally, ZIKV has been associated with a number of neurologic complications including microcephaly and other birth defects, Guillain-Barre syndrome, meningoencephalitis, myelitis, and various ophthalmologic abnormalities.Summary Treatment for ZIKV disease is supportive. Those in ZIKVendemic areas should protect themselves from mosquito bites by wearing insect repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants when outdoors, and/or using air conditioning or window screens when indoors. Furthermore, unprotected sexual intercourse should be temporarily avoided by those who recently traveled to endemic areas.

Zika virus - A vector borne zoonotic disease: An international public health emergency,"Bobade, SS; Gade, RM","The geographical distribution of Zika virus has expanded tremendously since 2007. The consequences of transmission of dengue and chikungunya, zika virus is the latest culprit in a long list of arbovirus epidemics that emerged as a global public health threat over the last decade. Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, first isolated in Uganda from a sentinel monkey in 1947, which is transmitted by Aedes genus mosquitoes, also transmits diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever. Mosquito and sentinel animal surveillance studies have demonstrated that ZIKV is endemic to Africa and Southeast Asia. It causes dengue-like syndromes but with milder symptoms. Among common clinical manifestations fever, arthralgia, conjunctivitis, myalgia, headache, and maculopapular rash. Newborn microcephaly, the most devastating and insidious complication associated. ZIKV, has been described in the offspring of women who became infected while pregnant. However, Zika virus infection in pregnant women has a suspected link with newborn microcephaly by mother to child transmission. In very few cases Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a rare condition in which immune system attacks the nerves, leading to muscle weakness and even paralysis. A number of countries have issued travel warnings and the outbreak is expected to have an impact on the tourism industry. This review is focused on zika virus transmitted by Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquitoes their symptoms, diagnosis, prevention, control strategy and treatment as an important challenge to public health emergency, monitoring environmental and climatic precursors of vector-borne diseases linked to integrated surveillance of human cases and vectors. Given the rapid geographic spread of ZIKV in recent years, a coordinated local, regional, and global effort is needed to generate sufficient resources and political traction to effectively halt and contain further expansion of the current outbreak. Certainly, raising awareness and increasing knowledge among the general public, public health practitioners, and policy makers about disease vectors and their relationship with infectious diseases.

Mathematical Modeling for Control Zika Transmission,"Nugraha, ES; Naiborhu, J; Nuraini, N; Ahmadin","After 70 years since the zika was identified in Uganda, zika is now documented in 62 countries. In general, people infected with this disease do not experience severe conditions, but for pregnant women can cause serious problems because the zika can spread to the fetus. One result, zika can cause abnormalities in the fetal brain called microcephaly. Control and prevention are very important to reduce the spread of this disease. Here, we discussed the problem of optimal control in the model of zika transmission associated with the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). Using the approach of optimal control theory, we completed the objective function so that the infected population and its control cost are minimum. Numerically using the Forward-Backward Sweep Method, we obtained the control design of ITN and IRS as a function of time. The results show that the use of both simultaneously is more effective in reducing the population of infection than the use of ITN alone or the IRS alone.",2017,,"13TH IMT-GT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICS, STATISTICS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS (ICMSA2017)",1905,,,WOS:000416961400032,10.1063/1.5012172,,#25381,Nugraha 2017,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study type (comment, letter, etc); Extractor (2024-11-13 19:57:27)(Select): conference proceedings; ",

Zika virus: A review of literature,"Moghadam, SRJ; Bayrami, S; Moghadam, SJ; Golrokhi, R; Pahlaviani, FG; SeyedAlinaghi, S","Zika virus (ZIKV) has two lineages: African and Asian. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are thought to replicate initially in dendritic cells and then spread to lymph nodes and the blood stream. Risk for infection through blood transfusion, sexual practices and perinatal transmission exists. The possible routes of perinatal transmission are during delivery, breastfeeding and by close contact between the mother and her newborn. Also, mucocutaneous exposures to the virus by infected blood or monkey bite, organ transplantation or hemodialysis are the other routes of ZIKV transmission. There are two types of ZIKV infection; Zika fever and congenital infection. Clinical presentation of Zika fever varies from asymptomatic infections to a self-limiting febrile disease with low grade fever, conjunctivitis, maculopapular rash, headache, retro-orbital pain and arthritis/arthralgia with periarticular edema, myalgia, vertigo, vomiting and asthenia. This clinical feature could be mistaken for dengue or chikungunya fevers. Microcephaly is the most important and frequently reported clinical picture of suspected congenital Zika syndrome. Laboratory tests are needed for diagnosis of ZIKV infection, because there is no known pathognomonic clinical, biochemical or radiological features. RT-PCR is the most well-liked assay.

Mathematical modeling of zika virus disease with nonlinear incidence and optimal control,"Goswami, NK; Srivastav, AK; Ghosh, M; Shanmukha, B","The Zika virus was first discovered in a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947, and it was isolated from humans in Nigeria in 1952. Zika virus disease is primarily a mosquito-borne disease, which is transmitted to human primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. However, there is documented evidence of sexual transmission of this disease too. In this paper, a nonlinear mathematical model for Zika virus by considering nonlinear incidence is formulated and analyzed. The equilibria and the basic reproduction number (R-0) of the model are found. The stability of the different equilibria of the model is discussed in detail. When the basic reproduction number R-0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is locally and globally stable i.e. in this case disease dies out. For R-0 > 1, we have endemic equilibrium which is locally stable under some restriction on parameters. Further this model is extended to optimal control model and is analyzed by using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. It has been observed that optimal control plays a significant role in reducing the number of zika infectives. Finally, numerical simulation is performed to illustrate the analytical findings.",2018,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICAL TECHNIQUES AND ITS APPLICATIONS (NCMTA 18),1000,,,WOS:000435018300114,10.1088/1742-6596/1000/1/012114,,#27654,Goswami 2018,Exclusion reason: not peer reviewed paper; ,
Vertical transmission of Zika virus and its outcomes: a Bayesian synthesis of prospective studies,"Ades, AE; Soriano-Arandes, A; Alarcon, A; Bonfante, F; Thorne, C; Peckham, CS; Giaquinto, C","Background Prospective studies of Zika virus in pregnancy have reported rates of congenital Zika syndrome and other adverse outcomes by trimester. However, Zika virus can infect and damage the fetus early in utero, but clear before delivery. The true vertical transmission rate is therefore unknown. We aimed to provide the first estimates of underlying vertical transmission rates and adverse outcomes due to congenital infection with Zika virus by trimester of exposure.Methods This was a Bayesian latent class analysis of data from seven prospective studies of Zika virus in pregnancy. We estimated vertical transmission rates, rates of Zika-virus-related and non-Zika-virus-related adverse outcomes, and the diagnostic sensitivity of markers of congenital infection. We allowed for variation between studies in these parameters and used information from women in comparison groups with no PCR-confirmed infection, where available.Findings The estimated mean risk of vertical transmission was 47% (95% credible interval 26 to 76) following maternal infection in the first trimester, 28% (15 to 46) in the second, and 25% (13 to 47) in the third. 9% (4 to 17) of deliveries following infections in the first trimester had symptoms consistent with congenital Zika syndrome, 3% (1 to 7) in the second, and 1% (0 to 3) in the third. We estimated that in infections during the first, second, and third trimester, respectively, 13% (2 to 27), 3% (-5 to 14), and 0% (-7 to 11) of pregnancies had adverse outcomes attributable to Zika virus infection. Diagnostic sensitivity of markers of congenital infection was lowest in the first trimester (42% [18 to 72]), but increased to 85% (51 to 99) in trimester two, and 80% (42 to 99) in trimester three. There was substantial between study variation in the risks of vertical transmission and congenital Zika syndrome. Interpretation This preliminary analysis recovers the causal effects of Zika virus from disparate study designs. Higher transmission in the first trimester is unusual with congenital infections but accords with laboratory evidence of decreasing susceptibility of placental cells to infection during pregnancy.

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.Findings The estimated mean risk of vertical transmission was 47% (95% credible interval 26 to 76) following maternal infection in the first trimester, 28% (15 to 46) in the second, and 25% (13 to 47) in the third. 9% (4 to 17) of deliveries following infections in the first trimester had symptoms consistent with congenital Zika syndrome, 3% (1 to 7) in the second, and 1% (0 to 3) in the third. We estimated that in infections during the first, second, and third trimester, respectively, 13% (2 to 27), 3% (?5 to 14), and 0% (?7 to 11) of pregnancies had adverse outcomes attributable to Zika virus infection. Diagnostic sensitivity of markers of congenital infection was lowest in the first trimester (42% [18 to 72]), but increased to 85% (51 to 99) in trimester two, and 80% (42 to 99) in trimester three. There was substantial betweenstudy variation in the risks of vertical transmission and congenital Zika syndrome.Methods This was a Bayesian latent class analysis of data from seven prospective studies of Zika virus in pregnancy. We estimated vertical transmission rates, rates of Zika-virus-related and non-Zika-virus-related adverse outcomes, and the diagnostic sensitivity of markers of congenital infection. We allowed for variation between studies in these parameters and used information from women in comparison groups with no PCR-confirmed infection, where",2020,,LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES,21,4,537-545,WOS:000637955800004,10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30432-1,,#27760,Ades 2020,Exclusion reason: reports metrics from other papers (not original estimates or primary data); ,Useful review; useful
DETECTION OF HUMAN ANTI-ZIKA VIRUS IgG BY ELISA USING AN ANTIGEN FROM <i>in vitro</i> INFECTED VERO CELLS: PRELIMINARY RESULTS,"Sumita, LM; Rodrigues, JP; Ferreira, NE; Felix, AC; Souza, NCS; Machado, CM; de Andrade, HF","Zika virus (ZKV) infection is a huge public health problem in Brazil because of the increased incidence of microcephaly in neonates from infected mothers. Detection of specific IgG antibodies in maternal serum samples constitutes an important approach for diagnosing ZKV infection and evaluating its relationship with neonatal microcephaly. However, as there is no serological test produced in Brazil to detect IgM and IgG antibodies against ZKV, we sought to examine specific IgG in serum samples from patients or suspected mothers to detect previous infection and to test for specificity with regard to flaviviral infections occurring in the same area. Brazilian Zika virus native antigens were obtained from infected Vero cell layers or free virions in the culture medium and then used in ELISA. We tested sera from eight ZKV RNA-diagnosed infected patients (ZKVR), seven neonates with microcephaly and their mothers after delivery (MM), 140 dengue virus IgM-positive (DM) and IgG (DG)-positive patients, and 100 yellow fever (YF)-vaccinated patients. According to the ELISA, ZKVR samples were mostly positive (7/8), and all the MM serum samples were positive for ZKV IgG (7/7). In contrast, cross-reactions for dengue or yellow fever-vaccinated patients were observed, including DM (48/95), DG (10/45) or YF (3/100) serum samples; however, these cross-reactions exhibited low antigen avidity so that 6 M urea largely removed this cross-reactivity, with only a few cross-reacting samples remaining (8/140). ELISA based on extracted virions was much more specific, with all ZKVR (8/8) and MM sera being positive for ZKV IgG (7/7) and only borderline cross-reactivity found for DM (6/95), DG (3/45) or YF (4/100)-vaccinated serum samples. This technique (ELISA) can identify specific IgG in ZKV-infected patients and may be helpful in diagnosing congenital infetions after maternal RNA virus clearance or in epidemiological studies.",2016,,REVISTA DO INSTITUTO DE MEDICINA TROPICAL DE SAO PAULO,58,,,WOS:000396241000004,10.1590/S1678-9946201658089,,#27850,Sumita 2016,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-11-28 21:15:34)(Included): pushign back because this is about development of an assay; ,

The objective was to verify the incidence of notified cases of Zika virus in the period from 2015 to 2016 in Cacoal - RO. The methodology used was a cross-sectional, descriptive documentary study with quantitative approaches using a semi-structured questionnaire of 16 multiple-choice questions that were extracted from the Zika virus (ICD U06) notification / investigation form according to the model of the ministry of Cheers. It was verified that in the municipality of Cacoal-RO, 57 cases of Zika virus and a suspected microcephaly case were reported, with cases of Zika virus corresponding to 37 females and 20 males. It was observed that of the women who were pregnant (5.4%), microcephaly was recorded and confirmed in one of them, corresponding to 50% of the cases (item 34 of the form).

Molecular evolution of Zika virus as it crossed the Pacific to the Americas,"Schneider, AD; Malone, RW; Guo, JT; Homan, J; Linchangco, G; Witter, ZL; Vinesett, D; Damodaran, L; Janies, DA","Zika virus was previously considered to cause only a benign infection in humans. Studies of recent outbreaks of Zika virus in the Pacific, South America, Mexico and the Caribbean have associated the virus with severe neuropathology. Viral evolution may be one factor contributing to an apparent change in Zika disease as it spread from Southeast Asia across the Pacific to the Americas. To address this possibility, we have employed computational tools to compare the phylogeny, geography, immunology and RNA structure of Zika virus isolates from Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas. In doing so, we compare and contrast methods and results for tree search and rooting of Zika virus phylogenies. In some phylogenetic analyses we find support for the hypothesis that there is a deep common ancestor between African and Asian clades (the ""Asia/Africa"" hypothesis). In other phylogenetic analyses, we find that Asian lineages are descendent from African lineages (the ""out of Africa"" hypothesis). In addition, we identify and evaluate key mutations in viral envelope protein coding and untranslated terminal RNA regions. We find stepwise mutations that have altered both immunological motif sets and regulatory sequence elements. Both of these sets of changes distinguish viruses found in Africa from those in the emergent Asia-Pacific-Americas lineage. These findings support the working hypothesis that mutations acquired by Zika virus in the Pacific and Americas contribute to changes in pathology. These results can inform experiments required to elucidate the role of viral genetic evolution in changes in neuropathology, including microcephaly and other neurological and skeletomuscular issues in infants, and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults.

HYBRID AGENT-BASED MODELING OF ZIKA IN THE UNITED STATES,"Kuhlman, CJ; Ren, YH; Lewis, B; Schlitt, J","Vector-borne infectious diseases present computational modelers with a unique challenge: finding the right balance between model fidelity and simulation costs. In this work, we introduce a hybrid agent-based model that achieves a balance that readily scales to problem sizes of millions of human agents and mosquitoes. Macroscopically, our model results agree with those from a low-cost compartmental model; microscopically, like agent-based models, it provides details at the individual level. We apply this model to a synthetic human population of 1.2 million individuals from Miami, Florida in the United States to model the Zika outbreak in the Fall of 2016. We identify two high-risk locations within this region, a detail which cannot be revealed by traditional compartmental models.

The Expanding Spectrum of Zika Virus Transmission: A Systematic Review,"Araujo, D; Boas, SV; Faluyi, U; Medavarapu, S","Introduction: Large numbers of confirmed Zika Virus (ZIKV) infections have been reported as a result of vector-borne and non-vector-borne transmission. With a recent ZIKV outbreak, several methods of transmission have been identified during this pandemic. Knowledge of transmission methods is essential to prevent further spread.Aim: To conduct a literature review on ZIKV and its methods of transmission, to improve the understanding of how the virus may spread.Materials and Methods: Systematic literature review was performed on methods of ZIKV transmission including: vector-borne, sexual, mother to foetus, blood transfusion, and breast milk.Results: A total of 18 articles were reviewed involving 2573 cases. Vector-borne transmission was most prevalent in ZIKV cases, followed by mother to foetus vertical transmission and sexual transmission. ZIKV has been detected in blood, urine, semen, saliva, amniotic fluid and breast milk. However, ZIKV is not present in all bodily fluids at one time. Blood and semen have proved to be infectious and a contributory to the spread of ZIKV. It is unknown whether breast milk is infectious to neonates.Conclusion: Our systematic review demonstrates the influence of different methods of ZIKV transmission possess with the spread of ZIKV. It provides significant implications on testing, prevention and control of ZIKV.

The Asia-Pacific origins of the current outbreaks of Zika virus,"Sam, JIC","Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito- borne arbovirus from the Flaviviridae family, first isolated in 1947 from a monkey in Uganda. In the ensuing decades up to the 2000s, there have been sporadic reports of infections and seropositivity in humans in Africa and Asia(1,2). The first isolation of ZIKV outside Africa was from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Malaysia in 1966(3). Seropositivity has also been reported in wild monkeys in Malaysia(3), although the relevance of this in sylvatic transmission of ZIKV is unknown. These studies suggest that there was endemic and mostly undetected transmission in Asia during this period.

Brazil was implicated as central in the ZIKV dispersion, however, a better understanding of the pathways the virus took to arrive in Brazil and the dispersion within the country is needed. An updated genome dataset was assembled with publicly available data. Bayesian phylogeography methods were applied to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of ZIKV in the Americas and with more detail inside Brazil. Our analyses reconstructed the Brazilian state of Pernambuco as the likely point of introduction of ZIKV in Brazil, possibly during the 2013 Confederations Cup. Pernambuco played an important role in spreading the virus to other Brazilian states. Our results also underscore the long cryptic circulation of ZIKV in all analyzed locations in Brazil.

"Surveillance of neurological syndromes reported at a federal hospital in a context of Zika, chikungunya and dengue epidemics","Pereira, AGL; Escosteguy, CC; Marques, MRVE; Bergamo, LC","Background and Objectives: The occurrence of neurological manifestations in the context of the circulation of dengue virus (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) in Brazil is a challenge for epidemiological surveillance. This study aims to describe the clinical-epidemiological profile of patients reported in a federal hospital with neurological syndromes potentially associated with these etiologies, in 2015 and 2016. Methods: Observational study, with analysis of secondary bases and data collection in medical records and epidemiological surveillance forms. We included cases reported in 2015 and 2016, meeting the criteria: a) neurological syndrome of undetermined origin and registry of previous viral infection up to 60 days before neurological symptoms, laboratory confirmed or not; b) neurological syndrome without prior viral infection up to 60 days before neurological symptoms, with laboratory confirmation for DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV in CSF, serum or urine. Variables analyzed: sex, age, race/color, scholarity level, municipality of residence, signs and symptoms, syndromic and etiological diagnosis of the neurological symptoms, place/ length of hospitalization and evolution. Results: 72 cases reported: 61.1% men, median age 37 years, neurological diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) 34.7% and meningoencephalitis 31.9%. Thirty-nine cases (54.1%) were classified as associated with arboviruses, 14 of them by laboratory criteria (3 ZIKV, 6 CHIKV, 4 DENV, 1 DENV + CHIKV) and 25 by clinical-epidemiological criteria.

Fractional Order Computing and Modeling with Portending Complex Fit Real-World Data,"Karaca, Y; Rahman, MU; Baleanu, D","Fractional computing models identify the states of different systems with a focus on formulating fractional order compartment models through the consideration of differential equations based on the underlying stochastic processes. Thus, a systematic approach to address and ensure predictive accuracy allows that the model remains physically reasonable at all times, providing a convenient interpretation and feasible design regarding all the parameters of the model. Towards these manifolding processes, this study aims to introduce new concepts of fractional calculus that manifest crossover effects in dynamical models. Piecewise global fractional derivatives in sense of Caputo and Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo (ABC) have been utilized, and they are applied to formulate the Zika Virus (ZV) disease model. To have a predictive analysis of the behavior of the model, the domain is subsequently split into two subintervals and the piecewise behavior is investigated. Afterwards, the fixed point theory of Schauder and Banach is benefited from to prove the existence and uniqueness of at least one solution in both senses for the considered problem. As for the numerical simulations as per the data, Newton interpolation formula has been modified and extended for the considered nonlinear system. Finally, graphical presentations and illustrative examples based on the data for various compartments of the systems have been presented with respect to the applicable real-world data for different fractional orders. Based on the impact of fractional order reducing the abrupt changes, the results obtained from the study demonstrate and also validate that increasing the fractional order brings about a greater crossover effect, which is obvious from the observed data, which is critical for the effective management and control of abrupt changes like infectious diseases, viruses, among many more unexpected phenomena in chaotic, uncertain and transient circumstances.",2023,,"COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS-ICCSA 2023 WORKSHOPS, PT I",14104,,144-159,WOS:001295263500011,10.1007/978-3-031-37105-9_11,,#30043,Karaca 2023,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study type (comment, letter, etc); Extractor (2024-11-13 05:57:17)(Select): Conference paper; ",

Efficiently targeting control measures is important since control can involve substantial economic costs. Targeting is not always straightforward, as transmission of vector-borne diseases is affected by various types of host movement. Here we assess how taking daily commuting patterns into consideration can help improve vector control efforts. We examine three tropical urban centers (San Juan, Recife, and Jakarta) that have recently been exposed to Zika and/or dengue infections and consider whether the distribution of human populations and resulting commuting flows affects the optimal scale at which control interventions should be implemented. We developed a stochastic, spatial model and investigated four control scenarios. The scenarios differed in the spatial extent of their implementation and were: 1) a response at the level of an individual neighborhood; 2) a response targeted at a neighborhood in which infected humans were detected and the one with which it was most strongly connected by human movement; 3) a limited area-wide response where all neighborhoods within a certain radius of the focal area were included; and 4) a collective response where all participating neighborhoods implemented control. The relative effectiveness of the scenarios varied only slightly between different settings, with the number of infections averted over time increasing with the scale of implementation. This difference depended on the efficacy of control at the neighborhood level. At low levels of efficacy, the scenarios mirrored each other in infections averted. At high levels of efficacy, impact increased with the scale of the intervention. As a result, the choice between scenarios will not only be a function of the amount of effort decision-makers are willing to invest, but largely epend on the overall effectiveness of vector control approaches.; ",

SWITCHING VACCINATION SCHEMES FOR VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES WITH SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS,"Liu, XZ; Stechlinski, P","Theory is developed for an epidemic model of a seasonally-spreading vector-borne disease using a hybrid system framework. Applicable to diseases spread by mosquitoes (e.g., chikungunya and Zika virus via Aedes albopictus), seasonal variations in transmission are modeled using switching parameters to represent term-time forcing. The vector agent is assumed to exhibit a period of incubation upon infection, modeled using a distribution. Three hybrid control strategies are analyzed in detail: switching cohort immunization, pulse vaccination at pre-specified times, and state-dependent pulse vaccination. Methods from switched systems theory are used to derive threshold disease eradication conditions involving the model parameters; convergence of solutions to a disease-free set or periodic solution is shown. A comprehensive analysis is performed to compare and contrast the different control schemes.",2017,,JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS,25,3,441-477,WOS:000411823900004,10.1142/S0218339017500218,,#31639,Liu 2017,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2024-11-20 23:35:18)(Select): model to assess impact of vaccination of arbovirus; Extractor (2024-11-14 03:27:57)(Select): requested from library; ,

Acute serum samples were tested for ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and chikungunya virus by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, anti-DENV immunoglobulin (Ig)M/IgG, and syphilis assays; convalescent samples were tested for anti-DENV IgM/IgG; and urine samples were tested for ZIKV by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. ZIKV disease was defined according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) guidelines.Results:Of 101 patients, ZIKV was confirmed in 43 cases and suspected in 34, and another diagnosis was assumed for 24 patients (dengue, secondary/latent syphilis, respiratory infections, human parvovirus B19, adverse drug reaction, musculoskeletal disorders, and acute gastroenteritis). ZIKV-confirmed and ZIKV-suspected patients reported similar signs and symptoms. Pruritic rash was the most common symptom, followed by myalgia, nonpurulent conjunctivitis, arthralgia, prostration, and headache.

Methods: 30 women were included in the study with suspected history of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy and fetal's brain altered on ultrasound diagnosis. Sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics, prenatal altered ultrasounds, HC and other perinatal outcomes have been described. The relation between HC and gestational age was analyzed by using random regression effects based on polynomials fractions. The Z test was calculated to determine an instant variant mean rate of the HC for each gestational age. Results: the mean gestational age of the ultrasound diagnosis was 33.3 + 4.7 weeks and HC at birth was 28.9 + 1.6 cm. The main altered brain ultrasound was microcephaly (96.7%). The analysis of the fetal head circumference showed an estimated increase of the average HC, as to gestational age, it did not occur in a linear form. The instant HC variation rate increased according to gestational age (p<0,001). Conclusions: Fetal's main morphological alteration was microcephaly, observing an increase in the head circumference according to gestational age in a non-linear form and the variation decreased with gestational age., Resumo Objetivos: descrever alterações ultrassonográficas intraútero, analisar o crescimento da circunferência cefálica (CC) fetal e desfechos neonatais entre casos presumíveis de síndrome da Zika congênita no Brasil.

An accurate differential diagnosis between ZIKV and CHIKV is of high clinical importance, especially in the context of pregnancy, but remains challenging due to limitations in the availability of specialized laboratory testing facilities. Using data collected from the prospective pregnancy cohort study of the Microcephaly Epidemic Research Group, which followed up pregnant persons with rash during the peak and decline of the 2015–2017 ZIKV epidemic in Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, this study aims to describe the geographic and temporal distribution of ZIKV and CHIKV infections and to investigate the extent to which ZIKV and CHIKV infections may be clinically differentiable. Between December 2015 and June 2017, we observed evidence of co-circulation with laboratory confirmation of 213 ZIKV mono-infections, 55 CHIKV mono-infections, and 58 sequential ZIKV/CHIKV infections (i.e., cases with evidence of acute ZIKV infection with concomitant serological evidence of recent CHIKV infection). In logistic regressions with adjustment for maternal age, ZIKV mono-infected cases had lower odds than CHIKV mono-infected cases of presenting with arthralgia (aOR, 99% CI: 0.33, 0.15–0.74), arthritis (0.35, 0.14–0.85), fatigue (0.40, 0.17–0.96), and headache (0.44, 0.19–1.00). However, sequential ZIKV/CHIKV infections complicated discrimination, as they did not significantly differ in clinical presentation from CHIKV mono-infections. These findings suggest clinical symptoms alone may be insufficient for differentiating between ZIKV and CHIKV infections during pregnancy and therefore laboratory diagnostics continue to be a valuable tool for tailoring care in the event of arboviral co-circulation.",2022,,The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,106,6,1711-1720,,10.4269/ajtmh.21-0449,,#31949,Lobkowicz 2022,Exclusion reason: no report of parameters (including seroprevalence and other measures of interest) or transmission models or historical outbreaks; Extractor (2025-04-02 00:01:43)(Select): serop; Extractor (2025-04-01 23:29:51)(Select): no outbreak; they test for IgG but group that together with PRNT and molecular testing so we couldn't get serop; Extractor (2025-04-01 19:23:39)(Screen): outbreak?; ,
