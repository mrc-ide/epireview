e683b20d3ace5ae880e863595a7078f5,564,Zika virus,Y.A,Terefe,Zika is a flavivirus transmitted to humans through either the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes or sexual intercourse with infected individuals. In this paper; we present a mathematical model based on these two modes of transmission. Using the next-generation matrix method; a threshold parameter called basic reproduction number is determined. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number in terms of parameters involved in its formulation is discussed. A dynamically consistent nonstandard finite difference scheme is designed to replicate the properties of the continuous model. Numerical simulations of the nonstandard finite difference scheme that we have constructed show the number of infected humans due to sexual intercourse with Zika virus infectious individuals. The numerical simulations also support the theoretical analysis of the model.,564,10.1007/s12064-018-0272-7,2,Theory Biosci,Anna Vicco,NA,209,218,FALSE,Yes,Yes,NA,NA,NA,Yes,Yes,137,2018,Terefe 2018,4,4,1

20b33325ec2e04f800032770a256b30e,890,Zika virus,D.P.,Rojas,Transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) was first detected in Colombia in September 2015. As of April 2016; Colombia had reported over 65;000 cases of Zika virus disease (ZVD). We analysed daily surveillance data of ZVD cases reported to the health authorities of San Andres and Girardot; Colombia; between September 2015 and January 2016. ZVD was laboratory-confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the serum of acute cases within five days of symptom onset. We use daily incidence data to estimate the basic reproductive number (R0) in each population. We identified 928 and 1;936 reported ZVD cases from San Andres and Girardot; respectively. The overall attack rate for reported ZVD was 12.13 cases per 1;000 residents of San Andres and 18.43 cases per 1;000 residents of Girardot. Attack rates were significantly higher in females in both municipalities (p < 0.001). Cases occurred in all age groups with highest rates in 20 to 49 year-olds. The estimated R0 for the Zika outbreak was 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-1.74) in San Andres and 4.61 (95% CI: 4.11-5.16) in Girardot. Transmission of ZIKV is ongoing in the Americas.

4a1b4eb91bc7c144f5766c5022434ab3,947,Zika virus,Julien,Riou,The recent global dissemination of Chikungunya and Zika has fostered public health concern worldwide. To better understand the drivers of transmission of these two arboviral diseases; we propose a joint analysis of Chikungunya and Zika epidemics in the same territories; taking into account the common epidemiological features of the epidemics: transmitted by the same vector; in the same environments; and observed by the same surveillance systems. We analyse eighteen outbreaks in French Polynesia and the French West Indies using a hierarchical time-dependent SIR model accounting for the effect of virus; location and weather on transmission; and based on a disease specific serial interval. We show that Chikungunya and Zika have similar transmission potential in the same territories (transmissibility ratio between Zika and Chikungunya of 1.04 [95% credible interval: 0.97; 1.13]); but that detection and reporting rates were different (around 19% for Zika and 40% for Chikungunya). Temperature variations between 22 degrees C and 29 degrees C did not alter transmission; but increased precipitation showed a dual effect; first reducing transmission after a two-week delay; then increasing it around five weeks later. The present study provides valuable information for risk assessment and introduces a modelling framework for the comparative analysis of arboviral infections that can be extended to other viruses and territories.,947,10.1016/j.epidem.2017.01.001,NA,Epidemics,Anna Vicco,attack rate in a figure; but no clear numeric values associated to each parameter,43,52,FALSE,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,19,2017,Riou 2017,7,7,1

We present a probabilistic model to assess risk of arbovirus outbreaks based on incident cases worldwide; on the probability of arrival of infected travelers; and on the abundance of the vector species. Our results show a significant risk of Chikungunya outbreak in Rome from mid June to October in simulations with high human biting rates (i.e. when >/=50% of the population is bitten every day). The outbreak risk is predicted to be highest for Chikungunya and null for Zika. Simulated increase of incident cases in selected endemic countries has no major impact on the outbreak risk. The model correctly estimated the number of imported cases and can be easily adapted to other urban areas where Ae. albopictus is the only potential vector present.,1117,10.1038/s41598-018-34664-5,1,Sci Rep,Anna Vicco,"data from WHO reports

31d9cf27ec168c81167903a7942a2ee6,12630,Zika virus,J.T.,Earnest,Dengue viruses (DENV) continue to cause large outbreaks in tropical countries; while chikungunya and Zika (ZIKV) viruses have added complexity to Aedes-borne disease prevention and control efforts. Because these viruses are transmitted by the same vectors in urban areas; it is useful to understand if sequential outbreaks caused by these viruses have commonalities; such as similar seasonal and spatial patterns; that would help anticipate and perhaps prevent future outbreaks. We explored and analyzed the heterogeneity of confirmed cases of DENV (2010-2014 and 2015-2022) and ZIKV (2016-2017) during outbreaks in the San Juan metropolitan area of Puerto Rico to explore their degree of overlap and prioritize areas for Aedes aegypti control. Deidentified; georeferenced case data were aggregated into grid cells (500 Ã— 500 m) within a geographical information system of the study area and analyzed to calculate the degree of overlap between outbreaks. Spatial autocorrelations using local indicators of spatial associations were conducted to identify significant disease case hot spots and correlations between outbreaks. We found that 75% of cases during the three transmission periods were concentrated in 25% of the total number of grid cells covering the study area. We also found significant clustering of cases during each outbreak; enabling identification of consistent disease hot spots. Our results showed 85% spatial overlap between cases of ZIKV in 2015-2017 and DENV in 2010-2014 and 97% overlap between DENV cases in 2010-2014 and 2015-2022. These results reveal urban areas at greater risk of future arbovirus outbreaks that should be prioritized for vector control.,12630,10.4269/ajtmh.23-0627,4,Am J Trop Med Hyg,Anna Vicco,NA,724,730,FALSE,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,110,2024,Earnest 2024,7,5,0.7142857142857143
