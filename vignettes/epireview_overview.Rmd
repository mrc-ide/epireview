***epireview*** contains the latest open access pathogen data from the Pathogen Epidemiology Review Group (PERG), who aim to extract modelling parameters for nine priority pathogens as defined by WHO. This R package contains tools to update pathogen databases with new peer-reviewed data as it becomes available, and to summarise the latest data using tables and figures.

There are several vignettes available:

-   [**Pathogen database options**](https://mrc-ide.github.io/epireview/articles/pathogen_database_field_options.html) which lists the options for each model, outbreak, or parameter field and describes how to access them using a function in the package.

-   [**How to update the database with new article data**](https://mrc-ide.github.io/epireview/articles/pathogen_database_update.html) to explain the process of updating the database with new article, model, outbreak, or pathogen data.

In addition to this, the github repo has a [**wiki**](https://github.com/mrc-ide/epireview/wiki) which provides details on the data extraction process together with examples and an overview of the quality assessment measures.

We also provide an empty [access database file](https://github.com/mrc-ide/epireview/blob/main/miscellaneous_files/DIDE%20Priority%20Pathogens%20-%20BLANK.accdb) which can be used as a starting point for any new pathogens which are not already covered by this review. For updates to the existing datasets please follow the [*How to update the database with new article data*](https://mrc-ide.github.io/epireview/articles/pathogen_database_update.html) guide.
