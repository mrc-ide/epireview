\usage{
article_column_type()
}
\value{
A list of column types for the article data frame
}
\description{
This function defines the column types for the article data frame used in the epireview package.
readr is generally good at guessing the
column types, but it is better to be explicit. Moreover, it reads a column of NAs as a logical vector, which
is particularly undesirable for us.
The function is intended to be used
internally by \code{load_epidata_raw} where the files are being read.
