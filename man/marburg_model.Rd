\title{Data on the models identified in the systematic review of articles related
to Marburg virus disease.}
\format{
A csv file containing the following parameters:
\itemize{
\item model_data_id = ID variable for the model.
\item article_id = ID variable for the article the model came from.
\item model_type = whether the model was compartmental, branching process,
agent/individual based, other, or unspecified.
\item compartmental_type = if the model is compartmental, whether the model is
SIS, SIR, SEIR, or "other".
\item stoch_deter = whether the article specified whether the model was
stochastic, deterministic, or both.
\item theoretical_model = "TRUE" or "FALSE". "TRUE" if the model is not fit to
data.
\item interventions_type = interventions modelled e.g. vaccination, quarantine,
vector control, treatment, contact tracing, hospitals, treatment centres,
safe burials, behaviour changes, other, or unspecified.
\item code_available = whether the code was made available in the article.
\item transmission_route = which transmission route was modelled, e.g. airborne
or close contact, human to human, vector to human, animal to human, sexual,
or unspecified.
\item assumptions = assumptions used in the model e.g. homogenous mixing, latent
period is the same as incubation period, heterogeneity in transmission rates
between groups or over time, age dependent susceptibility, or unspecified.
\item covidence_id = article identifier used by the Imperial team.
